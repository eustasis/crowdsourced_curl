       "28629  What do you think of the Cantu curl line?With all this Deva Curl madness I am properly paranoid now despite the fact that it has been my lifeline for the past 8 months. I am thinking about investing in the Cantu regular shampoo. I have high porosity, thick 2b-2c hair. Do you think it could work for me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

After the put that in I'll use either the Cantu coconut curling cream or the Cantu moisturizing curl activator. Every 2 days use the Cantu Curly Cream Rinse Out Conditioner. \\n\\nI notice with the leave in conditioner that it does what it says on the bottle and leaves moisturizing oils in my hair. Whenever I take a shower though, I can still feel it in my hair and I don't know if should completely rinse that stuff out or just leave some of it in? I need my hair really wet so that I can re-apply the leave in conditioner repair cream after the shower. \\n\\nDoes it work best when some of the leftovers oils are in there or when it's all rinsed out? I've tested this and I've had mixed results, sometimes it works better when I do both ways. \\n\\nAlso this leads me to my next question, should I even be using the leave in conditioner repair cream everyday? Or should I just use it a few times and then just use the other standard Cantu Leave in conditioner (not one of the repair creams)\\n\\nIt's annoying because Cantu makes so many different products and they all have the same descriptions and I don't know really what they all mean. I'm going out on a whim and just winging it here. Sometimes my hair looks good when I use the different products so I honestly don't know what I'm doing.                                       \n",

       "25237  Should I use Cantu Shea Butter Hair Dressing Pomade as the Cream in my LOC?So I have Cantu Shea Butter Hair Dressing Pomade and I was wonder if this would work more as a cream in LOC or something I do after the cream? Should I switch it out for the cream I currently use which is OGX’s Quenching+ Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter? I’m asking cause I’ve heard that Cantu is supposed to be a really good brand and I had this laying around so I just wanted to try it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
