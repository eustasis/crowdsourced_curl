29312,4,7,2,0,/r/curlyhair/comments/g6mvz5/protien_mask_options_in_canada/,"Protien mask options in Canada?Hello! 

I‚Äôve recently started to try and get my curls back to the land of the living and have been fiddling with my routine to see what my hair likes and/or needs. And I *think* it may need protein. 

I‚Äôve got colour treated medium/high porosity 2B/2C (I think) hair. My BFF is my stylist and she thinks it‚Äôs more medium porosity than high but Im leaning to higher due to the amount to if colouring I do to it. It‚Äôs fine but I have a fair amount of it. 

I am recovering from a major surgery where I lost 35-45% of my volume and in the last 8-9 months it‚Äôs started to grow back and I have A LOT of baby hairs coming in. The amount of volume when my hair was at its prime was about three times the amount of an average (based on the amount of colour my BFF uses to do my shoulder length hair). 

Here‚Äôs a photo of day one vs a week in (second photo is day two hair fresh out of its pineapple):

https://imgur.com/a/fTXd4Bf 

Here‚Äôs my routine: 

- I used Live Clean Apple Cider shampoo to reset

- I‚Äôve used Maui moisture coconut shampoo just on my scalp lightly to wash. 

- deep condition with Garnier fructis one minute hydrating mask (the coconut one) for 5-10 minutes while I shave my legs. I rake it in and then s2c it a bunch. 

- condition with maui moisture coconut conditioner (rake to de tangle and remove fallen our hair and then s2c) 

- I apply Marc Anthony curl lotion (I used it in high school when my curls were healthy and they liked it then) - again, I rake it in and then s2c 

- apply garni√©r fructis structure sculpting gel. I know the CGM states to use A LOT and I used about a golf ball and a bit and squished it in while my hair was soaping wet in the shower when my head was upside down. I have good clump formation when it‚Äôs soaking wet but it does tend to separate into thinner clumps after I‚Äôve plopped. 

- plopped in a t shirt for 20 min. 

- I do diffuse because I cannot stand having wet hair touching the back of my neck or around my ears and I feel the compulsion to run my hands though my hair. I followed the naturally curly tutorial from their website. 

Results have been good considering I heat styled my hair for the last 15 years. I don‚Äôt get a cast on my hair to SOTC which I expected considering how much gel I used but I think I could use more. 

The curls are in an ok place for me but they‚Äôre a little soft and fuzzy - more on one side of my head than the other. The small amount of frizz i know it‚Äôs coming from the colour damage and new growth so I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôve over moisturized it. 

Also to add: I plan to cowash with Amika nice cream (it hasn‚Äôt arrived yet and I know it‚Äôs not CGM approved but I bought it before understanding CGM and will use it up before going on to try something else as it cost an arm and a leg ) 

So my question is: what can I do to add protein back in? I‚Äôm in Canada so my options are DIY or Shea moisture. Or Is one of the GF one minute masks a protein option? I do like those on my hair but none of them straight out say I‚Äôm a Protein mask!‚Äô On the tub like Shea Moisture does. 

I‚Äôve looked into the gelatine diy mask and would be interested in trying that but I‚Äôm not sure which option may be best.  

Sorry for the novel! I really wanted to get as much info in here as possible.

My brother has super curly hair (somewhere between 3C and 4A) and he‚Äôs been growing it out, but he doesn‚Äôt know how to manage with it and I just noticed that it‚Äôs severely matted in certain areas. I have very curly hair as well but it‚Äôs never gotten this bad and I don‚Äôt want him to be forced to cut it üòû

I tried searching for myself online but I‚Äôm getting so many mixed responses. What I‚Äôm thinking is doing a hair mask for an hour or so and then brushing out each section with my fingers as much as I can - then applying oil/moisturizer to the untangled bits and using a wide-tooth comb with the knots that are left. Is that right or should I be wetting the hair more? Please help me help him, the matts look so uncomfortable and I feel awful that I didn‚Äôt help him earlier (I don‚Äôt live at home and am the only one in the family with comparable curls, I didn‚Äôt realize he was having such a hard time).

Also suggestions for products would be awesome! I have honestly 0 idea what would be good for him and want to run out and get it tomorrow before he comes over - I live in Toronto so if anyone here knows the city please let me know. Otherwise product suggestions would be great and I‚Äôll hunt them down. :)

So when I started the CG method I had a really thick head of 3B/3C curls and had lots of ringlets. Without changing my routine up at ALL my hair texture and thickness has completely transformed. The two things that happened around the time it changed were:

1. I got my hair cut shoulder length (it's back to its usual length now)
2. I used a deep conditioning mask from Shea Moisture that turned out to be really thick and horrible and made my hair very greasy and fine.

My hair density has gone as well. It used to take about 6 hours to fully air dry whereas it now takes around 3-4. Don't get me wrong, my hair is very soft and doesn't tangle anymore which I used to have a big problem with, but instead it just flops around and using gel on the curls is useless as they end up looking like wavy strands stuck together. 

I use the exact same co-wash as I've always used but I have had to stop using DevaCurl gel products (a staple in my 3C routine) as they now make my hair greasy-looking and fine. 

I've tried adapting my products to suit finer curly hair but it doesn't accentuate the curls and they're still totally devoid of life. I keep reading that when you lose your curls you are supposed to moisturise more but all this does is weigh them down.

I am beginning to think that my previous curls (and frizz, which I actually kinda liked) were just damaged hair follicles. I'm also beginning to think that my hair has stopped growing as this is the longest time I've gone without having to trim my fringe and it seems to have stayed this length for a long time. 

To put it into perspective: I used to completely air dry my hair and have thick ringlets all over. Fast forward to now and most of my curls are resistant to scrunching, plopping and diffusing (on a cold setting).

My hair is straight-ish underneath and I have a mix of ‚ÄúS‚Äù curls and corkscrews on top. My hair is fine in texture and I have a LOT of it. (I can put it into a bun wet in the AM and it‚Äôs still damp that night.) It is color treated but I‚Äôm neurotic about minimal bleaching. 

Not currently CG but thinking of going back if I can find a way to fix this issue. 

The problem: need gel to get any kind of defined curl pattern but it leaves my hair looking wet long after it dries. 

Routine: 

Back in the day, I typically applied gel at the end of my routine onto wet hair (sometimes over a leave in, sometimes not), scrunched out extra water with a t-shirt and plopped or diffused it (sometimes both).  Despite playing around with everything listed below, my DRY hair on its best days looked wet  - no joke, people asked me about it. And the ends would still be in these little gel clumps. 

Troubleshooting: 

-I tried different gel brands and holds
- I triple checked the ingredients of everything that went on my hair
-I switched to a mousse
-I tried different amounts of gel. I‚Äôve done everything from piling on a full gel helmet to just waving a closed bottle over my curls.
- I tried plopping
-I tried diffusing
-I tried plopping and then diffusing
-I tried different conditioners and creams under the gel
-I scrunched the crunch every way I could think of. I even scrunched the crunch one curl at a time. It took hours and I just looked frizzy.

18681,5,6,4,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/f9tfnk/curly_girl_method_and_scalp_grease/fitpx4l/,"One clarifying reset wash is usually good. I used Bumble &amp; Bumble Sunday Shampoo but there are others out there (and are listed on the wiki in the sidebar if you're accessing from your computer ... I don't think it shows up on mobile). Maybe see if you can get a sample since you won't likely be using this shampoo often. 

You may want to do a deep condition after the reset wash because clarifying shampoos can be pretty stripping (drying hair out). The more textured your hair, the more conditioner seems to be necessary (more texture/curl = drier hair) so if you're a wavy then you may not need to do the leave-in conditioner. It depends on how dry your hair is. A lot of us discover CGM after years of chemical and heat abuse and end up with high porosity hair that absorbs moisture quickly but also loses it quickly. If that's the case for your hair, you may need more conditioner and products to seal in moisture at least until your hair settles down and heals. 

As for a hair cut, that can help move things along for sure. So can regular trimming. I have 3a/b hair that's fine and high density (lots of it) and got ends trimmed which got rid of the stick straight pieces at the ends of my curls and made a huge difference without losing a lot of length. It might work for you too. 

I recommend seeing someone who specializes in wavy/curly hair. Regular stylists are often trained to help wavy/curlies tame their texture instead of working with it. One of the things my last stylist did was to drag his shears across my layers, kind of like a razor, to help add volume.

Styling gel

As a TON of you probably know, there's been a lot of controversy with DevaCurl.  Personally, I've been using the products for over 4 years as an absolute DIE HARD and well... over the years my hair has changed from 3B/3C Botticelli/Corkscrew to a solid 3A Botticelli/Cherub.  There's actually sections of my hair that are straight now and I literally went to my DevaCurl stylist about hair loss during my 2nd year of using the products and she told me that ""it was normal for curly hair"" so I didn't question it.  Why would I?  I was in high school and got all of my hair care information from YouTube.  My parents both have straight hair so they didn't know what to do either. They literally took me to the DevaCurl salon because ""they were the best.""

Yeahhhh.  Yikes! 

With everything that it going on, I'm cutting out DevaCurl until the lawsuit and further information is released to prevent further damage BUT I have absolutely no idea what to use! I've exclusively used DevaCurl products for years and I'm at a total loss! I can't just go completely product free because when it's dry, it falls out in clumps and I work in a major office that networks with members of federal and international governments so I HAVE to look professional, hair included. 

The Products I used to use were: 

DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser 

DevaCurl One Conditioner 

DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel

And as a once a week ""natural hair mask"" with eggs, honey, and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. 

So question: what can I use instead of DevaCurl that will not only moisturize my hair but will help restore the curl pattern that I have lost?

This November I started my curly hair journey and I went for **DevaCurl NO POO &amp; ONE CONDITION**. Since there weren't allot of options locally, I went online and splurged in a shopping spree and I was so happy because these products worked really well for me‚Ä¶.  Until they were empty and I had to reorder and I saw the price that made me dizzy!! 

\#2C #3A #Thin #normalporosity 

&amp;#x200B;

So my search for CG started again and I found SHEA MOISTURE in a local store. *\*Finally I thought\**  
Half the price, more product and curlybot told me it was all okay to use. So I opted for **Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo** &amp; **Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner** especially for my overly straightened &amp; Color treated hair! (In stores we only had two types and the other one was more for 4 a/c hair types)

  
To be honest I disliked the smell of both products, but I wanted it to work so badly!  
\**It smelled like unrefined honey but it a very weak way or Camille ..... I don't know what but I didn't like it!\**   
So ignoring my senses I started my CG routine and the shampoo is allright in my opinion. It's more of a 'low poo then a no poo product and it kinda screwed with my senses and I doubted the CG approvedness for a second because of the foaminess and checked but it seemed to be all right. But sadly the Conditioner really did not work for me at all! I tried to use a little and allot but no way I could untangle my hair with it, I retried for 2 weeks but it really doesn't do anything for my hair except for making it slightly heavier then needed. In the end I do love te pump on the bottle and that's the only positive thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The conditioner bottle is going to be saved because of the pump but the insides are going to be dumped, I'll keep the shampoo on the side if I feel like having and extra cleansy feeling but I just really prefer my DevaCurl combo that I ended up reordering today after not knowing what to do with my untangle mess of a hairdo after Shea Moisture.

Okay, with that out of the way, hi. I'm a natural curly girl who used to have type 3b hair while I was growing up. I say used to, because my family eventually pressured me into damaging my hair enough that my curl pattern is permanently destroyed.

What I'm hoping for advice on is how to help my family accept my curly hair and all the good and bad hair days that come with it. My family was and still is cruel as hell about my natural texture. Everyday in high school, they told me it was a frizzy, immature, ugly mess, even when I tried to make it look nice. I'm not sure why I bothered, because there seemed to be a lot of racism involved.. I'm white as can be, and yet they told me (very frequently) that I had ""n* * ger"" hair"" and that I needed to fix it. And I did try to ""fix it"" and fix their racist bs, and it wrecked my hair and my confidence in them. I finally started the CGM about a month and a half ago, but the comments haven't stopped years later. I'm disgusted and ashamed that my family has such screwed up, racist ideas in their heads, and I'm honestly at a loss for what to do. They make me want to quit trying and go back to straightening once my hair grows out. What should I do? Do I give up? Do I keep trying to change them? And if so, then how?

26791,4,7,2,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/gy2qsq/2a_medium_porosity_low_density_fine_hair_first_2/,"2a medium porosity, low density, fine hair. First 2 days of figuring out if my hair is actually wavy. Need advice pleaseSo first of all, I‚Äôve only done this for two days so I‚Äôm at the total beginning of my journey. 

Some facts about me. 

I‚Äôve always had relatively okay hair. A weird mixture between wavy and straight, mostly soft, a little frizzy, started styling my hair maybe once every week or every two weeks about 5 years ago.

I used to have long hair but bleached it silver. Loved it but it killed my hair so I grew it all out. Now all of my hair is virgin hair. I don‚Äôt plan on colouring it anytime soon.

I‚Äôve been watching YouTube videos about wavy hair and took a quiz on hair types. My results are listed in the title. I think they seem about right, I know a little about certain things to do with wavy hair from those videos but I‚Äôve only tried them once. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/HKyINJw) are some pictures from my first time trying a new routine. I made sure to brush my hair before I washed it and didn‚Äôt brush it at all afterwards. I very lightly deranged my hair with my fingers because I washed my hair with my head over the bathtub. 

I used the Maria Nila True Soft Shampoo (sulphate free but silicones), Arctic fox periwinkle hair dye and tried to squish to condish (used as conditioner bc I didn‚Äôt have anything else). Then I squeezed out all the excess water and turned my head upright.  Detangled as described above and used a small microfibre towel to scrunch the excess moisture out. Then I applied about 2 pumps of the catwalk by tigi curls rock amplifier to my hair by scrunching it in. Then I let it air dry. Once it was dry I scrunched out the crunch. 

Now the results weren‚Äôt perfect but I have to say the first day was pretty cool. I hadn‚Äôt had natural waves like that before, only the very Fine face framing layers maybe. 

Thing is, I went to a BLM protest earlier and it was raining pretty much the whole time. After that my hair felt awful, still had some curl but lots of pieces were crunchy and mostly straight. I brushed it out tonight because I‚Äôm going to bed and washing my hair tomorrow anyway. 

Any advice? I don‚Äôt have money to purchase a bunch of new products right now but I‚Äôm saving up to get the Kinky Curly Knot today and possibly the Macadamia Weightless moisture shampoo as I saw those products recommended for 2a hair. However I‚Äôd like to find a way to use my existing products (the tigi cream and my Redken one United leave in conditioner). 

Other products I have at home: Head and Shoulders Argan oil infused shampoo, John Frieda original hair mask. 

If anyone has any recommendations I would GREATLY appreciate them:)

21262,4,3,2,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/ctx81g/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/ey73n0d/,"I think it is a little short-sighted to try to reduce this to a math problem from the product manfacturers' perspective. Companies supply according to demand, customers heavily drive that demand, and cultural influences play factor into that. Here in the US, beauty standards have been heavily driven by Eurocentric standards for a \*very\* long time, and have also been fairly strict and requiring conformance, even for Caucasians with straight hair. Straight hair is has an easier time conforming to to those beauty standards and suffer less from the lower cost products produced with cones, or high in inert chemical (that dilute the healthy ingredients). And our society would rather have us conform to that standard than appreciate this individuality. And certainly companies do find it easier to be profitable in this type of environment. But only because as a culture we still make it easy for them.

As a side note, in another thread it obliquely came up why the natural hair community for black women and men is so important to them that they feel defensive of the appropriation of this particular part of black culture being appropriated by blacks. While the percentage of non-blacks with curly hair is a number much smaller than 100%, all african americans have some texture to their hair, and most have a texture &gt;=3b, most even have a texture in the 4s. For an african american to conform to this rigid beauty standard,it is energetically expense, takes process that are unhealthy (and as sidenote, while it has a payoff, still left them at a disadvantage because racism). And they have had to deal with this culturally for hundreds of years. It is only the past maybe 40-50 years that the natural hair movement has started getting any traction within the african american community, and maybe 20 years (don't know) that it started paying off culturally. People who are fairly new to the CG method really have no idea how radical it is to find products from companies like Mielle, Camille Rose Naturals, As I Am in places like Target.

These sorts of discussion don't seem to be welcome here on reddit, and definitely no one wants to read discussions like this. But that's not even the tip of the iceberg. This type of question could fill a dissertation. The whole discussion of hair could be someones career.

Someone advised to scrunch some gel into it and said that most everyone here likes LA Looks Blue gel. Ironically, my mom, who has very short hair (almost buzzed) uses the LA Looks spiked which is the step above the Blue Gel. I thought, what the heck and gave it a try knowing that it may be too heavy because it is a higher hold than the Blue gel. Well, needless to say, I think it helped a lot! Here are some before and after pictures. The top is before and the below is after (today). What do you guys think? I will take any advice or suggestions also!

32644,7,3,2,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/8r8wgq/very_curly_dry_coarse_hair_and_i_need_help/,"Very curly, dry, coarse, hair and I need HELP!So let me preface this by saying I'm 17, male, and I have little to no knowledge about the ""CG method"" or honestly, how to properly care for curly hair. I've also recently stopped getting ""low fade"" haircuts on the sides and back of my head so I can grow it out to be as long as the hair on top of my head. I think I have **3a or 3b curly hair**?? and **it is naturally sooo dry and coarse**. My curls are large and clump together easily when soaked and my hair also takes a while to absorb moisture when I shower.

The only two products I'm currently using rn: 

(Maui Moisture Conditioner) [https://www.amazon.com/Maui-Moisture-Conditioner-Detangles-Defrizzes/dp/B01MSHRR93?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Maui-Moisture-Conditioner-Detangles-Defrizzes/dp/B01MSHRR93?th=1)

(Head and Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo) [https://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Almond-Dandruff-Shampoo/dp/B001F51RF6](https://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Almond-Dandruff-Shampoo/dp/B001F51RF6)

I used to use OGX Coconut Curls shampoo and conditioner but the fragrance was intense and sometimes my friends would say my hair smelled bad when they went in close for a sniff (I know, embarrassing).

My shower routine for my hair is basically: Letting it soak for a while, probably 5 min, then shampooing based on how greasy my scalp feels, (massaging my scalp without really working it into the ends because my hair is so tangled). Then after rinsing it I put a coin sized amount of the conditioner listed above on my hands and work it through the ends of my hair (avoiding my scalp and the roots), this also means ""scrunching"" (?) or squeezing my hair to help form the curls. I keep it in my hair for about 5 more min then thoroughly rinse. Okay, I know this part sounds weird but to dry my hair I basically hold my towel in front of me and slam my hair on it to get the excess water out and let it air dry, but i pat the sides of my head since the hair is shorter. Some days I only soak my hair with water. I wake up with a frizzy mess so I'm forced to  ""shower"" nearly everyday. I also currently don't use any products besides shampoo and conditioner.

I try to shampoo every 3 days and condition right after but sometimes my scalp feels greasy meanwhile my hair feels dry, so I end up shampooing more or conditioning only, it's so frustrating. I also get small dandruff flakes constantly which is why I use H&amp;S but I learned about sulfates so after looking through many different shampoos, I'm thinking about getting DevaCurl No-Poo (as my main ""shampoo"") and Nizoral (for dandruff) to use at least once a week?

I'm sorry for the very long post, I just want to have healthy curls and much of the advice I find online is conflicting and no one else in my family has hair like mine so I grew up on knowing just shampoo or 2-in-1's. As of writing this, I haven't shampooed or conditioned my hair in about 3 days (only soaked with water) and my hair feels so disgusting. It's so dry and I don't know which product is the culprit, but I feel residue or product in my hair when running my fingers through my hair and it even stays on my fingers)

21295,1,2,4,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/d00lop/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/ezko4ox/,"Curl types are just for fun!

1=straight hair
2=wavy hair
3=curly hair 
4=kinky/coily hair

A, B, C are subcategories. A is the least and C is the most. So 2A is the minimal amount of wave/closest to straight hair and 4C is the tightest type of curl, including a z-type shape.

3A-C to me is generally spirally. 

It's common to have multiple hair types, sometimes divided by the different parts of your hair (ex. Crown vs closest to your neck vs the rest of your hair). So like for me I'd say I have a range of 2C, 3A, 3B. Some people have more uniform hair.


Hair type CAN corellate with porosity and hair level, but it's not a hard rule. Ex. Finer hair might tend to be more porous and in need of protein while kinkier/coarser hair might be less porous and need moisture and little if any added protein.  But it's not always a straight match up.


Knowing how fine/thick your hair is, how porous it is, and hair much protein it needs (or doesn't) is gnerally more useful.

27086,4,3,2,7,/r/curlyhair/comments/9qsl1l/question_has_anyone_else_noticed_their_hair/,"Question: Has anyone else noticed their hair become straighter after using natural hair treatments?Hey guys! Just discovered this sub and had some questions about hair care. I apologize in advance for any errors I might make.

I had straight-ish hair when I was a child until I hit puberty. It became wavy and I am not too familiar with curl types but it seems close to 2B. I have never colored my hair other than using henna on it last year but I have black hair so it didn't really do anything other than give it a reddish tint which was visible only in the sun. For the longest time, years in fact, I blow dried and straightened my hair every time I washed my hair and ended up damaging it a lot.

For the past year and half, I have stopped doing any kind of heat treatments to my hair and apply coconut oil masks regularly. It has helped improve the quality of my hair immensely. I recently incorporated almond oil into my routine and have also used egg, honey and mayo masks that are supposed to enhance curls. This made my hair even softer and shinier but I noticed that my hair now appears straighter, more like 2A curls.

I am not sure why this is happening and was hoping to see if anyone else faced similar issues. I love how my hair feels but I miss my curls. I was wondering if I can continue these treatments but also keep my curls?",2b,  question     anyone    else    noticed    hair    become    straighter    using    natural    hair    treatments hey    guys     discovered    sub    questions    hair    care     apologize    advance    errors    might    make     straight ish    hair    child    hit    puberty     became    wavy    familiar    curl    types    seems    close    2b     never    colored    hair    using    henna    last    year    black    hair    really    anything    give    reddish    tint    visible    sun     longest    time     years    fact     blow    dried    straightened    hair    every    time    washed    hair    ended    damaging    lot     past    year    half     stopped    kind    heat    treatments    hair    apply    coconut    oil    masks    regularly     helped    improve    quality    hair    immensely     recently    incorporated    almond    oil    routine    also    used    egg     honey    mayo    masks    supposed    enhance    curls     made    hair    even    softer    shinier    noticed    hair    appears    straighter     like    2a    curls     sure    happening    hoping    see    anyone    else    faced    similar    issues     love    hair    feels    miss    curls     wondering    continue    treatments    also    keep    curls   ,question anyone else noticed hair become straighter using natural hair treatment hey guy discovered sub question hair care apologize advance error might make straight ish hair child hit puberty became wavy familiar curl type seems close 2b never colored hair using henna last year black hair really anything give reddish tint visible sun longest time year fact blow dried straightened hair every time washed hair ended damaging lot past year half stopped kind heat treatment hair apply coconut oil mask regularly helped improve quality hair immensely recently incorporated almond oil routine also used egg honey mayo mask supposed enhance curl made hair even softer shinier noticed hair appears straighter like 2a curl sure happening hoping see anyone else faced similar issue love hair feel miss curl wondering continue treatment also keep curl,question anyone else noticed hair become straighter using natural hair treatment hey guy discovered sub question hair care apologize advance error might make straight ish hair child hit puberty became wavy familiar curl type seems close 2b never colored hair using henna last year black hair really anything give reddish tint visible sun longest time year fact blow dried straightened hair every time washed hair ended damaging lot past year half stopped kind heat treatment hair apply coconut oil mask regularly helped improve quality hair immensely recently incorporated almond oil routine also used egg honey mayo mask supposed enhance curl made hair even softer shinier noticed hair appears straighter like 2a curl sure happening hoping see anyone else faced similar issue love hair feel miss curl wondering continue treatment also keep curl,Moisture/Masks,Curlygirl/Devacurl/Sulfate-Free,Cutting/Growing,Drying Routines

I usually add a few drops of essential oils as well. 

My dc routine:
1. Use a low poo or buildup buster by devacurl. 
2. Detangle with a conditioner or cowash. 
3. Apply the deep conditioner to my hair (split into 2 sections). Thoroughly coat all my hair. 
4. Put it up with a disposable plastic shower cap over it. I‚Äôll either then use a blow dryer to heat up the cap and then put a towel over it, or I recently bought a Hot Heads heat cap. Let it sit 15-30 minutes. 
5. Rinse it out really really really well under slightly cool water (I will freeze if I use cold water lol) 
6. Style as desired (only a little bit of leave in conditioner and then other products). This is a good time to rinse your body - mine becomes super slick from rinsing out the dc.

It used to be so curly!First of all I want to say that it's the first time I'm using reddit, I've tried to read everything (rules etc) but I'm still not sure if I'm doing this right..and also English is not my first language so I hope you'll understand what I mean!

My natural hair type is 3b, I've always had splendid locks without even taking care of it because my mom didn't know how to (my dad has curly hair but he never really cared) and now that I'm spending money it looks nothing like it used to be...
Story:
I've dyed my hair for years, bleached it a few times and straightened it every weekend. I only used shampoo, didn't care to detangle it, used a normal towel to dry it and needless to say it wasn't curly anymore, just VERY fried and without a single strand of hair that even remotely resembled a curl. But at least it was long, like (almost) waist long. 
I chopped it. Keep using dye.
Chopped it again.
(I think it's important to say that I was suffering from severe depression at the time).
Finally I stopped using dye and started to take care of it, but it was still damaged because I had to lightly bleach it again.
In September I had my serious, first real chop (chopped it at ears length, maybe even shorter) and it looked MUCH more healthier.
Unfortunately I was stupid enough to dye it again (with a non aggressive dye).. So I waited for 3 months and went to a hairdresser to help me cover the ""damage"" I've done.
Did nothing until February, chopped it off again.
I'm very upset because I'm trying to take care of it but it looks soooo thin and without volume, it looks like I have very few hair... Also it looks damaged even though I'm not straightening it, not dyeing it, not anything.
Maybe it's for the products I'm using? They're all from normal drugstores (I can't afford expensive ones) so I'm trying to wash it with just water...
I've tried everything, every technique.
But they didn't work.
Maybe I can't do it properly?
Also I wanted to ask hairdressers but they don't know s**t. I live in a small Italian city from the south and like 98% of people has straight hair. 
They had the audacity to tell me I should straighten my bangs every day and that straightening my hair once a week wouldn't damage it.

I will then bunch my hair up and wrap it around my head kinda like plopping and will start doing my morning routine and by the time I‚Äôm ready to go out my hair will be 85% dry and I‚Äôll leave the rest to the  natural air. 

My main problems are curls that won‚Äôt clump as well without leaving in conditioner and some frizz.

Recently color treated, tangly, different patterns, and possibly seborrheic dermatitis?My hair is hip length.  The front of my hair and the surface/top layers of my hair look 1C but the back of my hair and underside of it looks like 2B.  It gets really frizzy and I have a TON OF IT. Super thick. 

 Each strand is very fine and I tangle very easily. If I don't brush it every few hours, I develop dreadlocks at my nape.  It's been like this since I was young.  

I get my hair trimmed every 4-6 months and have always taken pretty good care of it.  I wash it 1-2 times per week and heat style it only 3-4 times per month.  I got some subtle balayage highlights recently (first time I have ever lightened my hair) and it is even harder to detangle than before.

My scalp tends to hand dandruff or flakes? I have recently learned about seborrheic dermatitis and feel this could be a possibility for me.  I have a very oily scalp that always seems to have flakes, itchiness, or redness no matter what I use.

I am not necessarily looking to reach my full curl potential.  I am just looking for: 

1. What I can do to make my natural waves look more uniform and nice on no-heat days since different parts of my head have different wave/curl patterns.

My current products are questionable. I checked the CG bot and some are complete nos and some maybes. Shampoo I use It‚Äôs a 10 ( CG maybe) and conditioner is Suave Keratin Infusion (CG no). Then I put in Noodle Head Curl Boost Glaze (CG approved) and finish with the Noodle Head Mouse(CG no)

My hair takes for.ev.er. to dry. Weekdays I plop into a t shirt then sleep but when I wake the roots have way too much volume and the ends are straight. The curl at the root makes the hair stick straight out. Some curls (like 2) come out perfect but I need consistency. 

I‚Äôve never had problems with my hair being dry or overly damaged. The chemically straightened hair has grown out now it‚Äôs just normal wear and tear from blow drying. The only heat I use now is a curling iron to make the straight or overly crazy sections mesh with the rest of my head. I‚Äôve also stopped getting my hair dyed and that is slowly growing out. 

Currently I‚Äôm plopping in a t shirt for a few hours then air drying the rest of the way. That seems to work the best but I don‚Äôt have enough time to do that on week nights. It can take a whole day to dry. 

I‚Äôd appreciate any help and advice you have for me. Besides shaving my head I can‚Äôt think of what else to do.

28257,4,0,6,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/d1d1j0/canada_styling_product_recommendations_2b_wavy/,"Canada styling product recommendations (2B wavy, low-porosity)?Hi all! I've been using really cheap, basic products since I started CG last year and I'm looking for recommendations for products to try to help definition/volume/hair health. My hair is 2B ish with low porosity. 

Current hair (sorry for garbage quality).

Current products:

Shampoo: Shea Moisture Argan Oil &amp; Almond Milk

Conditioner: Tresemm√© Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish

Gel: Dippity Doo xx-treme hold gel

The gel gives me good definition, but also my hair kind of feels dry after.

My hair is a delicate drama queen, so it needs the gel or some kind of styling product for it to have any definition whatsoever. I've heard people talk about gels, mousses, oils, sea salt sprays, curl creams, butters, etc. and I have no idea where to even start with them (aside from the very basic gel I use now) or even what the difference is between a lot of those products! I'm also quite sure a lot of them would be too heavy for my hair.

Do any other low porosity wavies have any styling products you swear by? I've heard really good things about cantu curl activator cream from people with curlier hair, but it definitely seems like it would be heavy for my hair.

I'll try to keep this short! 

Broke my leg, haven't washed hair in 4 weeks, cast off on Tuesday and I can't wait to shower properly!! 

I have roughly 2a hair currently - it's pretty soft, but still greasy (I've not maintained it in any way, just brushed it through with my fingers - I knew this post was coming, just took my time getting round to it!). I think it could get to more of a 2c. 

I'm vegan, so no egg washes, thank you :D I'm sure they're great, just not for me. (We also have hard water). 

I dye and bleach my hair (regrowth is about 2"" in the last 8 weeks - I'd just done a touchup). I'm going to try stripping the hair colour and then dying - but I might bleach if I think it needs it.

I want to nourish/clean my hair, strip the old colour (changing colours slightly - more purple than the blue it is now), maybe bleach, redye, condition.

So, questions:

* What order should I do things in? Clean/strip/colour/condition?
* How should I clean my hair after 4 weeks of no washing?
* What should I do going forward?
* What products? 

I'm really up for changing my routine, but I'm concerned dying my hair crazy colours isn't compatible with the CG method?

I'm sorry if this comes across like I've done no research, I have, it just seems like there's a lot of contradictory information and I'd love to know first hand what you guys think :).

I tend to wet my hair every other day as a matter of styling, alternating between co-washing (or at least, just putting conditioner on the ends and combing upwards slowly to detangle) and shampoo+conditioner, with every other shampoo day being a SLS day to clear out any gunk.

Except the gunk only ever seems to come in one spot, behind my ears/on the back of my head. It's bizarre if I leave out the styler: the top and front of my hair end up dry and frizzy, whilst the back and underneath ends up greasy, tacky and somewhat brittle.

It feels horrid.

I'm sure it's got something to do with me not rinsing out the conditioner properly (probably related to just how shit our shower head is at producing water).

Is this a bad thing in the long run (i.e have I fucked up my hair since it's probably been like this since I started CGM in January)? And more importantly would water be enough to wash out any ""accidentally left in"" conditioner?

When I first decided to not put any dye or heat on my hair in hopes for faster hair growth, it was shoulder length, 3 years later and it‚Äôs still shoulder length.

Let me tell you about my hair routine: I wash my hair once a week. I‚Äôm using deva curl products and I love them. I bought the all curly hair type package and it works great except for the No Poo Shampoo (I think my hair might be protein sensitive and the shampoo makes my hair feel like gunk), so I use just Argon Oil of Morocco shampoo brand. I‚Äôm gentle with my hair when drying with a towel. I use rosemary essential oil and rub it into my scalp. Occasionally I‚Äôll use hair masks. For 2 years I use to get trims every 3 months, but it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything at all, just cutting off my growth. For the past year, I haven‚Äôt gotten any trims, still nothing. My diet is not good though, I‚Äôm a full time college student and work full time. So I guess my question is how often should I use hair masks - what kind should I use for growth and split ends?

15998,4,7,0,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/ayhh4l/10_months_into_cg_method_victory/ei0rxrx/,"I have 3a, protein loving, low porosity hair. Fighting frizz and staying moisturized are definitely my main challenges with this hair type. 

Current routine: 

I wash every 4-5 days depending on my schedule/how my hair is looking. 

Wash days: 

 1. Co-wash with Eden Bodyworks Coconut Co-Wash. I really scrub my scalp and then soak my hair with this stuff and finger comb to detangle. Then I clip it all up and throw on a shower cap. Set the shower to hot to create steam to open up the hair shaft and allow the moisture to soak in. Really important step for low porosity hair! Otherwise the product just sits on top of your hair and doesn't actually moisturize the way it should. Rinse well with cold or cool water. 

 2. Deep condition with SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Hair Masque. I use squish to condish here plus add a little extra closer to the scalp too. Clip up, shower cap, hot steam (same set up as above). Rinse completely with cold or cool water. 

 3. Apply Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-in using S2C method

 4. Apply Biotera Alcohol Free Defining Gel using S2C method. It makes my hair clump up nicely and creates a light gel cast. 

 5. Scrunch out water with a cotton T-shirt. I usually just air dry after this, but if I'm more in a hurry I will diffuse on low temp using the pixie method until about 30% dry then air dry the rest of the way. Scrunch out the crunch once it's completely dry. 

Non-wash days: 

I sleep with a silk pillowcase, which helps a lot with avoiding frizz while you sleep. Seriously, this makes a huge difference! 

- On days 2-3, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair and apply some SM leave-in (listed above) and then biotera gel using S2C method for both. Air dry then scrunch out the crunch. 

- On days 3-4, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair and use the SM leave-in and ECO Aloe Vera Styling Gel using S2C method. This gel has a stronger hold and is good for re-forming curls that have come undone over the first couple of days. Air dry then scrunch out the crunch. 

Notes: 

-Every month or so, I will also cleanse my hair with whatever cheap shampoo we have in the shower to get rid of any build-up.

-If my hair is particularly dry and frizzy (usually in winter months), I will also do extra deep conditionings on day 3 by rinsing my hair with cool/cold water and applying SM Manuka &amp; Mafura Hair Masque (same as above). Then I clip up my hair, put on a shower cap, and diffuse over the cap on medium temp for 10-20 minutes. Rinse out completely with cool/cold water. This really helps me keep up with much-needed moisture.

I'm almost a full month into CGM and I'm trying to be patient while my hair figures itself out, but I would love some advice on two points: definition and refreshing. 

I have swavy hair which is showing up as 2A-2B right now but I do think with time and care, I have more wavy potential. I have dense med-low porosity hair but would love some advice on how to boost up the wave definition, as I'm still pretty new to all of this. Routine in comments!  


I also notice that on wash days,  I have some lil waves going on, but by Day 2, they are completely gone, not to mention Days 3, 4, etc. My hair is way too short for a pineapple and I did order a sleep bonnet to see if that will help keep things in shape overnight. I also have noticed that getting my hair anything less than soaking wet for a refresh makes it ""still not defined, but now also frizzy"" so I've been dunking my head in the shower every morning, microplopping, then letting it air dry. Any suggestions on a better way to refresh? Am I doing something wrong? 

I know it's entirely possible that I just need to keep waiting to let my hair get accustomed to this new method, but I don't have any heat or bleach damage, so I guess I was hoping for a little more of a result by the end of my first month. 

Thanks so much to this sub for SO much knowledge and advice!! Y'all are the best.

25844,4,7,5,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/bzv5uc/wavy_here_new_to_cgm_tipsinsight_welcome_and/,"Wavy here new to CGM - tips/insight welcome and appreciated!Hello all! I've been going down the rabbit hole of all things curly girl method for the past week or so, and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and confused about some of the information I've come across - but also so excited to start this hair journey! I'm definitely not a curly haired girl by any means, but I've definitely got some waves in my hair that I think are only going to get better the longer I'm at it!

My first application method as follows:

1. Washed my hair after a week of not washing with Innersense Color Awakening Shampoo
2. Deep conditioned with Curls blueberry bliss reparative hair mask for 5 minutes then detangled with wet brush after failed attempts with wide tooth comb with the deep conditioner still in (my hair gets so tangled when it isn't dry brushed before hand)
3. Roped in small amount of Giovanni leave in conditioner to soaking wet hair
4. Roped and scrunched in small amount of Moptop curly hair custard
5. Scrunched in very small amount of Innersense I create hold gel
6. Wet plop in a shower cap for about 10 minutes
7. Took hair out of shower cap and let it air dry
8. I scrunched out the very minimal crunch I had once it was air dried.

[Wash day of Day 1 CGM](https://i.redd.it/eei8yfzf0z331.jpg)

[2nd day hair refreshed with a mix of water and my Innersense sweet spirit leave in conditioner](https://i.redd.it/m4cp54l70z331.jpg)

So my first wash day wasn't strictly cgm - I didn't do the ""final wash"" with a sulfate shampoo because I haven't used any products containing silicones/sulfates and nasty stuff in probably 2 years or so? I switched over to Innersense products a while ago and to my knowledge they don't contain any of those ingredients. However, I'm thinking I should still probably do that clarifying wash, no? Because you can still get buildup from other products regardless I think.

I also used a wet brush while the deep conditioner was in my hair - because the comb was NOT doing a damn thing - I didn't use the brush again after that though.

All in all this first wash was kind of half-assed - I had a limited amount of time to devote to my hair because I had to be into work a little earlier than normal - and I was also apprehensive to put too much gel/curly hair custard in so I put in very little which I think resulted in a lot of fall out. I don't think my results were necessarily bad but they weren't great either - I feel like my hair in the first photo seems a little weighed down with products? Anyone care to agree here?

This is where I'm confused and could use some help: I think my hair is probably 2a, maybeeee some of it 2b and high porosity - because it dries pretty quickly and almost always develops frizz - but it's also on the finer side. I don't know I'm just completely at a loss so if anyone has any advice on that feel free to share.

I also can't tell if my hair is in need of protein or if it has too much protein? I've read explanations of this but I'm still confused about it so if anyone can tell judging by these photos please let me know!

My typical routine (left picture) is to shampoo once a week with Devacurl Low-poo delight weightless waves and then co-wash during the seek with Devacurl one condition delight weightless waves. I then use Devacurl  Ultra defining gel.

After seeing some posts here I decided to try the rake and shake method (right picture)! I watched [this video ](https://youtu.be/_G9cgMqYafM) someone else posted here and was very interested in how she recommended keeping the hair very hydrated. I washed with my usual Devacurl shampoo and conditioner above. Then I applied some Devacurl Leave-in decadence and plopped for about 10 minutes. Then I added a little more of the Devacurl leave-in. I think this was key for my hair as I don‚Äôt normally use this product.

As I followed the tutorial video, I used a spray bottle to dampen my curls and add the Devacurl Ultra defining gel. As I started, I noticed that as I ‚Äúraked‚Äù my hair there didn‚Äôt seem to be much curl once I shook it out. So I tested out *skipping the rake* (my curls were already detangled and separated from the plop) and that seemed to work much better for my curl type (2b or 2c maybe?).

Routine for the bottom picture: I brushed my hair with a wet brush before my shower (This was probably really bad in hindsight, I haven't done this normally.) I clarified yesterday night with Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo. I do this about every two weeks right now. I deep conditioned with a mixture of about 25% SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Masque and 75% Argan Oil &amp; Almond Milk Smooth &amp; Tame Masque (Because that's what I had at the time.) I combed it with a wide tooth comb while still wet. I flipped my hair and scrunched it a little dry with a t-shirt and then added about a half dollar size amount of Diva Curl Wave Maker. I then plopped for about 15-20 minutes and let the rest air dry. When I woke up this morning I wet some of the hair in the front with warm water and scrunched in a little Herbal Essence Totally Twisted. 

My routine would normally be wash every 2-3 days. Shampoo with SheaMoisture's Superfruit Complex and condition with TRESemm√© Botanique Coconut. Sometimes I'll mix it up and use SheaMoisture's low porosity conditioner and/or shampoo instead. 

Two years ago I submitted a post on Reddit asking for advice about what to do with my hair. I was pointed in the direction of this sub, but at the time I didn't think I would get much from it/wasn't ready to put the work in. I started my ""curly hair journey"" at the beginning of this year. Now, one year later, this is where I am. I'm both excited to see my progress and a little frustrated with it. I definitely didn't get immediate results, and it feels like it's been a super slow process. I still also feel like I'm not doing it right. I have no idea what my porosity is or curl type. Some days I feel like it's just 2a waves, and other days it feels like I get actual spirals!

What kind of shampoo do you use? Try different kinds! The best shampoo I‚Äôve ever used was from CurlMix. My second favorite when i don‚Äôt feel like waiting on that to ship is a moisturizing shampoo from Shea Moisture cuz it‚Äôs in the drug store and affordable. 

I wouldn‚Äôt deep condition every day. They work best after a good shampoo because product build up can also dry out your hair. And if you‚Äôre using only a sulfate free shampoo, it probably isn‚Äôt strong enough to wash all that build up out. (So having a trusty sulfate shampoo for a once a month thing is helpful for some.) If you HAVE to get your hair soaking wet every day, i would just co-wash. You can buy an actual co-wash (my favorite has been Carol‚Äôs Daughter and you can find it in the drug store) or any conditioner you like really. 

With that being said, my hair personally works best when it isn‚Äôt getting soaking wet every day and I‚Äôve seen the same from others. I put my hair up in the shower to let the steam hit it as a way to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù my hair whether it‚Äôs braided or loose. 

Also, try to find your hair porosity. You may be putting too much moisture into your hair and not enough protein which can also lead to dry, brittle hair. Protein treatments once a month or whenever needed (like if the actual strands are week or if you dye/bleach hair) can be a game changer. And there‚Äôs many ways online for different ways to test your hair porosity and you can find products that can help. A tip: coconut oil acts as a protein so be careful with those products if your hair doesn‚Äôt like/need protein! 

Sorry for the text wall but that‚Äôs all the advise i can think of off the top of my head and i hope they‚Äôre helpful!!

My routine: 


1) Wash with As I Am coconut co-wash (right side up for this, but I do flip over at the end and comb from the nape of my neck upward to make sure I got everything. Although much of my hair is fine-textured, if I'm very thorough, my hair and scalp love it. This was a game-changer. My hair hasn't had any oily build up yet, but if it does, I'll use Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus shampoo.


2) Condition with Shea Moisture coconut and hibiscus shampoo. Flip head over and comb (wide-tooth) until smooth. Then rinse right-side up, squish to condish a little more in, and comb upside down one more time. Then do everything else! 


3) Get out, dry off, absorb excess moisture with a soft t-shirt. I'll add a bit more co-wash as a leave-in, comb through upside down one more time. Add LA looks extreme hold gel in sections with very gentle praying hands so that I don't stretch out my curls, making sure to get each section. 


4) I'll hang off my bed for a bit so my hair is toward the floor, watch the Office, flip my hair from one side to the other without breaking the curl pattern just so it doesn't flatten into a part, flip back over, whatever feels right. I'll cool-diffuse my bottom layers as they tend to go straighter due to heat damage. I'll cool-diffuse the rest, mostly focusing on my scalp and straighter bits, very gently if I feel like it. Sometimes I don't. 


5) I gently wrap or plop my head in a silk scarf at night, endure boyfriend teasing me (he thinks the CG method is super extra and adorable, but LOVES that I wear my hair curly now). It's usually fine in the morning, but if not, i'll spritz the misbehaving sections with water and brush some gel over it, then scrunch. I make sure my curl sections aren't too big, or they get dragged down.

\- My hair is very fine + extremely heat damaged (split ends to the max)

\- Low porosity (i think.. it gets greasy real quick! yes super damaged, but not dry)

\- Pretty solidly type 3A (fine, 2C - 3B!)

The problem: even after SOTC, my curls are **stringy**. Not an issue with cast - just that they are separate and kinda ""thin"".

My typical routine:

\- V05 shampoo like every other day (I feel so dirty otherwise!!! How do i stop??)

\- Devacurl low poo

\- Squish to condish maui moisture

\- Scrunch in garnier pure clean gel while still dripping wet/in shower

\- Plop/microfiber towel

\- I've been diffusing and it helped, but hasn't fixed the issue!

Today I tried shampoo, low poo, Devacurl condish, plop for 10 mins, then sectioning and doing some rake + shake action for clumpier curls. Well, the rake ended up killing my curls so I ended up scrunching the gel in. Maybe I ended up with too much gel? Or my hair was too dry by the time I put it in? Because all that made my hair stringier than ever. So I tried diffusing... Anyways, this deviation from routine fucked me up and my hair is so damn stringy!!! I think the look would be fine for some people, my hair is just so thin/fine/short that it's not working for me.

Should I finger coil? Or do the technique where you section and roll your head around to encourage a curly clump?? Or am I just \*transitioning\*??? Or is it just all the MF damage????? Heelppp!!

live clean coconut milk shampoo

la looks (using currently) 

Hey all! So basically I have been using the same shampoo/conditioner/milk/gel for a while now and my 2c/3a curls looked decent but they weren‚Äôt anything to write home about. So I decided to try la looks because of how much this sub recommends it. At first I was AMAZED, My hair had never looked more defined or softer or shinier! Unfortunately......that was 3 washes ago. Every wash since then my curls have gotten less and less defined. Initially I assumed I needed to do a reset wash so I did but that didn‚Äôt help at all.

Thanks if you actuslly read all this and help, haha.So I have very fine hair with like, 3 different curl patterns (2C, 3A, 3B). I've tried every way to do my hair, but for the last year my hair won't act like it had been for the past  10 before that.

Right now, I use innersense which I loved and started by recommendation by my awesome curly hair salon... I didn't know about that app that rates products thinkdirty, when I got them by the way; anyway I digressed... I use a chelating shampoo once a week, the ion from Sally's, and that's helped with fullness for sure. Also the Redken Cat protein is great too. As well as the Sally's generic brand of the matrix conditioning balm. Though, I only use the balm when I use the chelating shampoo otherwise I get moisture overload easily, so the Redken helps keep my strands in check. I also squish to condish! 

I've tried washing upside down, normal right side up. Adding products in upside down completely soaking, damp and between. Adding product right side up, soaking, damp and between. I've tried air drying, though using my diffuser seems to give me the best results still... I've tried a little and a lot of product and all amounts  between with again, either soaking, damp and in between wetness levels.

Raking seems to break up my curls and make them thin straw like. Scrunching, pulsing or glazing do not distribute the product at all either. The Denman and wet brush both do nothing to help either. 
I've tried many techniques using these brushes and nothing special other than distribution of product.

Right now, what seems to work the least bad, haha, is washing like normal, using the ion, innersense or the conditioning balm... Then I get some water out but still leave some in, enough that there's a lot but it's not dripping. I add a tiny tiny amount of the Blueberry Bliss leave in, which seems to be a great one, it's light enough but conditions well too, unless my hair is too moisturized, I'll skip that step that (and I'll conditioner if it's like crazy moisturized on accident, but that's rare). I'll add the Biosolk Hard Gellee which is a great hold, but I have to add a little bit, a penny amount. Then I plop gently while I do my skincare, then I diffuse upside down. I've tried the hover method, but shockingly doing the old school pile the curls into the diffuser and keeping still leaves my curls looking better, or not as bad, ha.

Think that's all. If you have any advise I super appreciate it and thanks SO much!!",3a,  sos    cannot    find    new    styling    routine         uuugh     thanks    actuslly    read    help     haha so    fine

So i have been struggling with a lot of dandruff lately due to the weather so i decided an oil treatment would help. I used mostly olive oil, with some vitamin e oil and about 10 drops of tea tree oil. I microwaved it on low for 2 minutes and applied to all my hair and scalp in sections. Then i put my hair in a shower cap and went to sleep. The next morning I shampooed 3 times with Suave‚Äôs Daily Clarifying Shampoo (contains sls). Wasn‚Äôt worried about stripping hair because oil had been sitting in it for about 12 hours. Then i did a lemon water rinse to clarify further, close my cuticle, and also help with dandruff. Let my hair dry in a t-shirt for about ten minutes, and applied aloe vera gel to damp hair. I rewet it and brush coiled, and scrunched out extra moisture with a t-shirt.

But I've gotten it cut short, at my collarbone (because the last time I did that my curls were at their best) with lots of layers. I thought that it would alleviate weight and help my curls to form.

I hardly ever use heat on my hair, 99% of the time I've air dried it, I haven't dyed it in 3 years, I dry my hair with a t-shirt, I use shea moisture shampoo and conditioner. It's gotten to the point where I can't wear it down anymore, it looks that bad. I've been doing everything the curly girl method states and if anything my hair has gotten worse. My actual hair is fine, so I'm wondering if shea moisture is too intense for it, or something. Can anyone give me advice or some product suggestions? Or any hair styles I can do to hide the bad hair?

24265,4,7,2,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/b6kzcf/ive_never_been_able_to_have_day_2_wavescurls/ejl621k/,"Hey y‚Äôall! I‚Äôm a long LONG time lurker here and ever since I moved to Florida in 2013 my hair has been a frizzy mess. When I lived in Pennsylvania my hair used to have the cutest little ringlets that would come easily with any shampoo or conditioner I‚Äôd use. 

Since then I made a reddit account and started lurking on here looking at pictures of men and women with beautiful curls and trying to figure out how to get that in this horrible humid climate I‚Äôm in. Since then I tossed out my brush, bought myself a wide toothed comb, and would only focus on combing my hair in the shower (for the most part). The hardest part came with finding the right products and since I was a teenager with a low attention span I just looked for anything with no sulfates and silicones and just winged it.

The funny thing is my epiphany on how to take care of my hair came to me within the last few weeks. I went shopping for shampoo and conditioner and Target was out of my go-to Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo and Conditioner so I decided to try out the Low-Porosity line for fun. It felt amazing in my hair and it only got better when I went in for a haircut and my stylist accidentally cut off way more than I wanted! But as it turned out my hair started to get more volume and curl into baby ringlets again! 

Finally over the weekend one of my guy friends and I were talking while I was kinda drunk and we talked about hair and how he hates how frizzy his is (it‚Äôs pretty coarse with high porosity but has a lot of potential). So I popped in here to look up what kind of products he‚Äôd need and that‚Äôs when I learned about porosity and how my hair has low porosity! As it turns out I‚Äôve been loading my hair with heavy products meant for people with 4a-c curl types while mine is/was usually 2c/3a and that‚Äôs why my hair hadn‚Äôt improved! So I bought a satin night cap and finally tried to do an overnight plop. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get the results I wanted since I toss and turn a lot while I sleep. So I tried to do it again, but while I got ready in the morning.

And so finally here‚Äôs my routine! I wash my hair with Shea Moisture Low-Porosity Shampoo. Then I‚Äôll use the Low-Porosity Conditioner comb it out, put in a little bit more, and S2C. Once I‚Äôm out of the shower I‚Äôll pat my hair dry for a bit with a t-shirt and put in Tresemme Curling Mousse. I comb it out again just so it‚Äôs parted in the direction I want and then I put it in my cap and continue gettin ready. Once I‚Äôm ready to head out the door I‚Äôll just take it out and let it air dry (I‚Äôll probably buy myself a hair dryer with a diffuser soonish).

As for my day 2 I just wake up and use my Shea Moisture Coconut Water Dry Shampoo and comb out some of my crazy strands with my fingers and go about my day! 

I‚Äôm so happy I finally figured out how to really take care of my hair you guys! It‚Äôs been a long time coming but my hair is beautiful and shiny and it has VOLUME!!! I‚Äôve never had that before even when I lived up north! If there‚Äôs any tips on how to take care of my hair that you‚Äôd recommend or any products please feel free to let me know!

Based on personal experience Cantu products are waaaayyyyy to heavy for my hair leave it feeling weird and completely negates any gel I put on it.
I know cantu says it's for all textures buts I've only seen it work on thick type 3 hair and type 4 . Same deal with shea moisture as well . The curl cream made my curls straight when I over used it. 
I have 2c maybe 3a hair.

Since your hair is fine I recommend you choose something lighter on your hair (I'm in the uk so I cant give good product reocmmendation)
Just saw you uk so I can actually help 
I use (whether or not its cG approved idk butnit doesnt have SLS in it)  an OGX bamboo fibre shampoo (whatever is cheapest from ogx) or the loam foam tresseme shine complex colour protect (those word different order). Conditioner I use anti g silicone free. Currently liking the garnier honey treasures one.

I use a leave in (garnier hair food) 
For you I highly recommend the tresseme botanique air dry curl cream (very very light). 

You can then either you gel or mousse. 
The gel (cant remember the name of it) but it's by shockwave and has a dumb name like extreme hold or something. Left a good cast. But I recommend you use mousse instead (any should work tbh)

I am 2b/c, but with very little encouragement my hair will form full on spirals and ringlets. Both times I left I immediately went home, rewet and restyled. Since then I‚Äôve been spot trimming


Personally I think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre often working with hair that doesn‚Äôt need nearly as much encouragement to do its thing, and curl types vary so much the ones at the salon I‚Äôve gone to tend to use the same technique for 2c curls that they use for 3c when it comes to styling, and it just doesn‚Äôt work.


I‚Äôm sure there are some out there that can truly work with all curl types, but even after going in the second time and specifically telling the stylist how I style (and having her complement how great my hair looked when I went in) I still left with hair that was nowhere near as curly or nice as I knew it could be.


I‚Äôm really surprised she COMBED YOUR HAIR after scrunch drying. That‚Äôs bananas. That‚Äôs like CG 101.


Honestly, and I don‚Äôt recommend this for everyone, but spot trims have worked for me and I‚Äôm gonna keep doing it. The good thing is it‚Äôs hard (for me) to screw it up, but I have also been trimming my own bangs and hair for years so I‚Äôm not too scared of it, I just go slow, sometimes doing it over a period of 2-3 days to make sure it‚Äôs not too much at once.

8390,1,0,2,7,/r/curlyhair/comments/giy1cc/why_is_this_community_so_hostile_please_take_a/fqhyc51/,"I feel like you've totally missed the point around what cultural appropriation means, and why it's important to understand that, and be aware of how it impacts others. 

[This article](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/06/cultural-appropriation-wrong/) is a great resource to understand what the concerns with cultural appropriation are about -- and it's not just cultural appropriation of black culture, all cultures. No one truly believes that if you lay out in the sun for a few hours to tan you're trying to be black, or that if women with naturally curly hair leave it curly are appropriating black culture. I have type 2b/2c hair, and no one tells me I can't call it curly, BUT I also don't go around referring to it as a fro, or that it's nappy, because 1) it isn't and 2) they're not my terms to use. 

If you go to Jamaica and a local braids your hair in a local style, it's not cultural appropriation, it's a cultural exchange and that's a great thing. It promotes learning, and understanding about a different culture. Same as if you go to a Muslim country and wear a headscarf or a veil -- you're respecting their culture and honoring their traditions. But there's a line there, that we need to be thoughtful about. 

People of color, and frankly anyone who isn't Christian, have been oppressed because of their cultural norms for centuries -- whether it's a black person wearing their hair in an afro style, or a muslim woman wearing a hijab -- they get ridiculed, demeaned and are generally treated poorly because they are different. 

This quote from the article really stands out to me, and hopefully it can give you some much needed perspective. 

&gt;""**When Black women have to fight for acceptance with the same styles a young white woman can be admired for, what message does that send to Black women and girls?**

But if your hair is high porosity and soaks it up, it may love it! The Target by my house has sample/travel sizes of curly hair products in the multicultural hair aisle, so I buy those to see if they work before I really commit. A lot is too heavy for me, but you just never know.

Routine if you're interested: 
Cowash with Suave coconut conditioner &amp; a scalp brush 
Condition with Garnier Fructis mango 1 minute mask and de tangle with wide tooth comb
Rinse and scrunch upside down for more volume bc my hair is FLAT
Camille Rose curl maker - scrunch in 2 pumps (adds definition)
LA Looks blue gel (good hold and CHEAP)

I actually wash my hair with a sulfate conditioner too! I have combo skin and it gets really oily in the summer, so I've been doing it once a week. In the winter I'm expecting to not have to do it very often or maybe even switch off between low poo and cowashing.

I love gel so much because it gives a lot of hold. Usually with mousses, I'll start the day with nice, lightweight waves and then by the end of the day,  they get stretched out. My hair also can't withstand any wind when I use a mousse. With a gel, strong winds will usually only add a little frizz, but otherwise, it's a disaster. Creams are too heavy and weigh my hair down enough that it looks straight and greasy.

Don't give up on your waves! For the first month, I was just happy I had anything at all, but now it's been about 3 or 4 and my hair is getting so much wavier!!

4258,5,7,2,0,/r/curlyhair/comments/a5tcj7/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_dec_13_2018/ebs5z0f/,"I'm a few days into the CG.. and i'm struggling. I think i'm somewhere between a 2b and 3a. More like 3a fresh out of the shower (at night) and first thing in the morning, 2a by the time we reach the kids nap time. I was told I have greasy wavy hair my whole life... my whole hair life is a lie :p 

Right now I've used the suave clarifying and have been using the suave conditioner and jel I found at Target (it was mostly CG approved- there were a few that the website warned I could have issues with.. but it was my only choice) I picked up the ""curly"" and ""sport"" holds. I'm in a parking lot and the kid is napping so.. 

In the shower if I'm not clarifying, I get my hair wet, rinse my hair, kind of massage my scalp a bit without anything but water. Then I slather conditioner, massaging more at the roots- then I grab my brush and fix my part and detangle a bit. Do the squishy condition thing, I then rinse out all my conditioner and depending on how ""crunchy"" or ""dry"" my hair feels I'll put a dab of conditioner in my hair to leave in. I do some other things in the shower not relevant here and then scrunch in my Gel. I then plop my hair in a t-shirt or microfiber towel for the night. 



My issues are these, and reading and rereading, youtubing and more reading is not helping. 

1) first day of a huge glob of gel I wound up washing it out because I put it in wrong, now I use a hair less and scrunch it in- the problem is my hair LOOKS wet and gelly and I cannot for the life of me get this to go away as claimed. 

2) using more gel or even anything else does not stop the sagging in the evening/afternoon. Mornings my hair looks great (aside the whole wet look) but afternoons it looks. Before CG I would wash, condition and use hairspray and it held slightly better on top, but not underneath. 

I'm gonna hit post so I dont loose this and will update with some pictures so you all maybe can give me some direction!

Then take a small amount of gel, rub it between your hands and with open palms, press it into your hair as though you were going to scrunch it - but don't scrunch.

21027,5,7,2,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/c05mn3/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/er3vqnl/,"So the short version of my question is this: how do I get my hair to tangle less?

For the first time in my life I've been growing my hair out past a couple inches and have been going for about ... hm... 2.5-3 years or so?  (Started with a buzz cut I was doing myself.)  Haven't had it trimmed at any point (might be time) and my ponytail hangs to about my shoulder blades, though my front hair goes to about mid-neck when going over my head back to the pony-tail.  Since about a year in, maybe a tad earlier, I've been using Shea Moisture products as they're easily available and I found them on the CG approved list.  I noticed a definite difference when I switched (when my hair got long enough to not use a 2-in-1, I had switched to a Garnier Whole Blends product based on off-hand and vague recommendations from friends with straight hair, but then did further research and found the CG method), but even after extended use, I still have a tangle problem.

I typically use the curl and shine shampoo and conditioner and the strengthen and restore leave-in.  I've also tried the strengthen and restore shampoo and conditioner from Shea (because the label said it was good for tangles), though I find I prefer the curl and shine conditioner better.  While trying the S&amp;R shampoo, I've also gone down to twice weekly shampooing (so I'm just coming to the end of that bottle, finally) and the rest of the week (I shower daily) I just use the conditioner to cowash and then the leave-in after the shower.  

When I shower, I comb through with a wide toothed comb to detangle and spread the conditioner evenly, then after the shower I use a wide tooth brush to finish detangling, apply the leave-in, brush again (same brush) to spread it more evenly, put it in a pony tail, apply Shea Moisture Mist and comb so the hair is even and orderly.  If I don't at least do this in the morning (as in, leave my hair dry or don't shower), my hair is a tangled frizzed out mess.  I don't do anything to bundle my hair at night, and maybe I should.  Might help that, I don't know.

My pony tail tends to curl into 2-3 main curls that are almost tube like, with some strays and frizz but that's been much better since the switch to Shea products (but still happens a bit).  I don't use a different style, because if I don't tie it back, my hair has a tendency to just fall in a curtain in front of my face rather quickly, and I don't know what I'm doing so I just stuck to a wash-and-go style (plus, I haven't wanted to deal with adding drying to my morning routine if I don't have to).

At this point I'm not sure where to go.  I just want to run my fingers through my hair without getting caught on tangles every time (even just a few minutes after I go through my morning routine).  Is this a pipe dream without straightening my hair?  I can reconcile with that, but I just don't know so I thought I'd ask if there's a way I can fix the tangling.

I live in a very arid climate (Nevada) and have fairly fine hair, though I haven't tested its porosity.  If I had to guess (I'm not expert) I'd say my curls are in the neighborhood of 3b-3c.

Side question: any ideas on what to do with the hair other than a pony tail that will keep it from falling in my face?

My regular hairstylist retired, so for my last two haircuts I‚Äôve gone to different people.

Both haircuts were after I actually started caring about my curls, so that definitely made a difference.

I am currently a 2B/C curl pattern, although in the past I was more of a 3A. I am currently using the Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle shampoo (low-poo) and the TRESemme Botanicals Coconut conditioner. I shampoo, add conditioner, use a wide tooth comb when wet in the shower to detangle, then S2C. I then squeeze any water out, apply a leave in conditioner (I am currently going between Not Your Mothers Naturals Leave in in the yellow bottle and Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave in) I then apply the blue LA Looks gel with praying hands, scrunch, and plop for about an hour. I then diffuse on low heat or cold.

I am still experimenting with products and attempting to determine my porosity (if anyone has any suggestions besides trial and error or the cup test, let me know!). 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to have better clumping or definition when drying?
2. I typically shower at night, but notice my hair is just flat and my curls have mostly been pulled out by the time I wake up. I am using the pineapple and a scarf and trying to refresh with conditioner and water (maybe I need more or to add more gel...) but is there a way to make the curls not fall flat the next day?
3. Is there a journal or tracking method (ie. google doc) that you use to document your hair journey and what works/doesn't?

I only wash my hair about once a week with some cheap organic shampoo and conditioner (#ballinonabudget). I use devacurl ultra defining gel in the shower and scrunch that in while ringing out my hair with my hands. Then I get out and add got2be kinkier mousse and plop for a few hours/overnight and diffuse on low heat. I usually sleep with my hair either in a top-knot kind of bun, in a crown roll, or in a braid of some kind. 
I pretty much spray my hair with water from a spray bottle every morning to ‚Äúreset‚Äù my curls/waves but sometimes I‚Äôll also add a spray-in curl booster or spot-treat with a curling wand.  I also only sleep with a silk/satin pillowcase or hair bonnet. Otherwise I wake up with unwanted dreadlocks haha

Questions: 
1. What hair type do you guys think mine is? I‚Äôve always thought I‚Äôm probably somewhere between 2B and 3A...
2. Right now I‚Äôm at all one length except for baby hairs/breakage/face framing cuts up front‚Äîany suggestions to help add shape/body/volume? 
3. My hair itself is dry but my scalp gets to looking very oily (from product buildup and general skin oil I guess) do any of you have suggestions on how to balance those two things? 
4. Any other general suggestions? My curly hair comes from my dad who wears it short and my mom has straight fine hair and no idea how to help with mine haha so I‚Äôm open to suggestions on styling and cuts :)

I‚Äôve always been pretty happy with my 2b-ish hair, but within the past few months it has developed strands that are STICK straight that float over the waves.

Months ago my hair stopped getting wet all the way and had dry flyaways that stuck to my hands even if it was sopping wet. I blamed it on protein overload and stopped using a protein fortifying shampoo, did a quick clarifying shampoo and deep conditioned it. That all helped but it never quite went back to normal and I still have the weird flyaways. 

If I twist the straight pieces with my fingers they don‚Äôt hold a wave for even a moment. It‚Äôs like trying to scrunch a piece of thread.

I never style my hair with heat, haven‚Äôt used sulfates for years and stopped using silicones and did a clarifying wash about two weeks ago. Was previously scrunching with strong hold gel (yes, had silicones) but since latest clarifying shampoo I only use a silicone-free creme gel or just leave in conditioner.

I‚Äôve checked my water and it‚Äôs not hard. I life in Florida, so my hair isn‚Äôt damaged from winter weather. I detangle It gently when it‚Äôs wet. I deep condition it regularly. Never colored it. Less than a year ago I had a blood test (unrelated condition) and only had a VERY mild vitamin D deficiency. Have been on the same birth control for two years.

Look... I do some minor ‚Äúbad‚Äù things that are against the curly girl dogma. I dry it with a regular towel, sure, and I used to sleep with it down and wet. But this is extreme.

During a depressive episode earlier this year I had a bad habit for a few weeks of using dry shampoo (Bautiste original scent) up to 3 times a week, but the hair-not-getting-wet thing started months before :(

8447,5,2,7,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/gljwku/is_my_hair_too_straight_for_the_curly_girl_method/fqz3zjh/,"You‚Äòll probably wanna start by taking a porosity test (you can find how to do it on Google‚Äîput a strand of dry, clean hair in a glass of water &amp; observe), then Google around or scroll through this reddit for suggestions on routines.

That being said, your hair sounds (&amp; looks) a lot like mine before I started learning how to actually work with it! I had issues with flat hair, grease by the end of day 2, didn‚Äôt use any products (also avoided conditioner because I felt it weighed my low porosity hair down but didn‚Äôt have the vocabulary to begin to search for one that would work), hadn‚Äôt used heat in 11 years. Volumizing products seemed a joke to me because they, too, seemed to weigh it down. Changing my routine helped nourish my hair from 1c barely-there waves like yours to 2b curls &amp; waves. They -do- flatten to 2a/1c after about two days without a quick but thorough spritz of water from a spray bottle (I have narcolepsy so it‚Äôs not always in the cards, energy-wise) so I still think I could do better, change some products, and achieve 2c &amp; lasting results but that‚Äôs a conversation for another post haha.

This may also be helpful for you: explore your hair‚Äôs past a bit. How has it changed over the course of your whole life? We know it‚Äôs thinning a bit because you‚Äôve stopped birth control‚Äîhow did it change since before you were on birth control? How effective are the keratin &amp; biotin products for you? Have you ever stopped using a product because it just wasn‚Äôt right for your hair? What are some other frustrations you‚Äôve had with it? How does it react in humidity or very arid climates? What was your hair‚Äôs texture like when you were little? Did it change when you were a teenager?

These could be the clues you need to tell you what your hair could become. I decided to start learning about my hair not only because of my frustration with products‚ÄîI also had a couple of unanswered questions about changes in my hair‚Äôs texture throughout my life. For example, why did I have 3a curls only until I was about 5 or 6‚Äîwhere did they go? I assumed this was because one‚Äôs hair texture changes as one ages, which can be true! But nothing I read indicated a drastic change like that‚Äî3a to 1c‚Äîuntil roughly puberty (13/14 for me). I recalled the frizz of my tweenage/teenage years‚Äîeven before I started using a hair dryer in middle/high school and having problems with hair static all day, it was often formlessly frizzy. What was with that? Since I‚Äôd stopped using heat &amp; being in that plastic-coated, heavily air-conditioned setting (and started giving myself mostly-bad shoulder-length mullet-lite haircuts), I hadn‚Äôt really had that problem. Which solution fixed the frizz? And then some long-repressed memories resurfaced of absolutely -hating- having my hair brushed when I was little. I was very tangle-prone and the results were often painful for me and frustratingly time-consuming for my parents. And my final questions had to do with my parents‚Äô hair: both had beautiful wavy hair. My mom‚Äôs medium-length hair and effortless loose curls (that she still constantly straightens, smh) seemed an indication that maybe mine is like that too, just cut poorly &amp; generally undernourished. Or too long and neglected. Like maybe‚Äîidk‚Äîmaybe I was doing everything wrong? Haha.

I only go into detail to illustrate that often, these questions remain open-ended. The answers can morph (and the question of what products don‚Äôt work for you will just have a longer answer over time ahaha). Or they might be as simple as ‚Äúvinyl bus seats and plastic desk chairs give every kid hair static in wintertime, luv xx always condition.‚Äù

Even if you don‚Äôt have similar questions or any answers yet, it can be rewarding getting to know your hair better. You seem to take very good care of it already, which is actually a great starting point. I‚Äôd say you should explore that wave! Find out what makes it happen. It -is- yours, and as effortless as it was, it was no accident!

EDIT: I know my response is already kinda tl;dr but I wanted to add that if you do decide to explore it (which I hope you do‚Äîto be clear, my answer is that your hair‚Äôs not too straight to benefit from the Curly Girl method), a really good, simple, and free starting point can be experimenting with what ‚Äúsquish 2 condish‚Äù can do for your hair. Scrunch your conditioner into your hair and scrunch water into it to rinse, and then scrunch in your post-conditioning products. Trying that, even with a sulfate- (or dimethicone-) packed shampoo &amp; conditioner, and seeing the results is what convinced me to invest in new products and have the patience to see what would happen.

Was using DC and found my hair thinning and breaking. I ditched DC but now I need help getting my hair healthy again.Hi! I'm a longtime lurker of this sub and I made a reddit account for this.

Here's me in late November, with my hair healthy next to a recent selfie. I miss her :,(
https://imgur.com/a/hZUwlfr

I'm going to the salon soon and am hoping to get professional advice as well. But in the meantime I wanted to see if anyone here had similar stories and could offer some help!

I've been doing CG for a few years with great results using DevaCurl! I would use No-Poo, One Condition, and SuperCream. But for a while I had a job outdoors and would tie my hair up all the time and only No-Poo and condition every few days. I started shedding a lot more around this time, so I got back onto my routine but I would shed just as much or even more! Once in the shower a whole glob of hair fell out. Then I found out about the ongoing DevaCurl lawsuit and ditched the products almost a month ago now.

I noticed a lot less breakage and shedding almost IMMEDIATELY with my newer products. As of right now I'm using Cantu shampoo and conditioner, Taliah Waajid curl cream, and KCCC. It's okay so far but my hair is much thinner than it used to be even less than six months ago and I just want my curls to be healthy and defined again. I've also been doing deep conditions with SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-In to try and restore my hair and that's been doing okay also. But none of it is really bringing me back to how it used to be quite yet.

tl;dr: I'm having to go on a new product and routine search since ditching DevaCurl after losing some hair, even though my DC routine was great for me at one point in time. But my main priority right now is to restore my 2c/3a hair back to how healthy it was.

Maybe your hair is too weighed down also. (Did you cut back the amounts of curl cream you use now that your hair is shorter? I know if I change my length, it is hard for me to remember to alter the amount of product and not use too much.) Also, as you can, look for products wavies use. Lighter products. With old drier hair cut off, you might being using too heavy of products on your healthy hair. (I find Cantu curling cream way too heavy, even using just a smidge)

Gel helps me. But not the LA Looks. My hair hates it. Mine loves either Mop Top or Kinky Curly Curling Custard. And go generous on it at the roots and the shaft of your canopy. You can scrunch out the crunch later.

I also get better second day hair and I don't know why. My hair can be wavy/loose curly 2c/3a on wash day. On day 2+ I get coils 3c/4a. Like the gel like being reactivated with water better than when its first applied. (I just mist with water and scrunch)

So my ideas for you are gel, lighter leave in conditioner and curl cream.

I tried to trim them myself last week, and slightly messed up the layers. They looked a little choppy and weird in some places, so I decided to go to a hairstylist. I went to the Aveda Salon, which I had not gone to before, however the stylist I went to was recommended by my friend with curly hair. I asked her to blend the layers in, but try and leave the length. 

My hair is I think 2c, but the very bottom layer of my hair is like a 2b or even 2a. It is a loose wave, sometimes almost straight. I pointed this out to her before she started cutting. My hair looks weird now. It seems thinner (maybe I‚Äôm imagining it) and there is a gap on one side of my head between the top layer and the bottom layer. The left side of my head seems fine but the right side, where the gap is, is kind of messed up. If there is an easy way to fix this gap please tell me! I hate it so much.

36279,5,7,2,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/byt7i3/need_new_product_suggestions_for_mysteriously/,"need new product suggestions for mysteriously damaged hair :(hi everyone! i need help! i have 3b high porosity hair, and i been doing the curlygirl method without exception for eight years. in that time i have exclusively used deva products and gotten deva cuts. i have never (in life!) straightened my hair, have diffused it maybe 2 or 3 times and otherwise always air dry, and only colored once when i got pintura highlights five years ago. i preface with this because my hair is really damaged, but it isnt from heat or color. i moved from the humid southeast to northern california four years ago and my hair took a nosedive. i never got it to curl like it did in the southeast, and hair stylists told me it simply wont because the humidity is different and so is the water. now ive moved to southern california which is even dryer and my hair is really a disaster. it is a damaged mess, it was so bad that the last time i went for a cut my trusted stylist who knows i hate to lose length cut off six inches because it was all so damaged and had thinned out so much on the ends. now my hair is super short (which i really dislike), wont curl, and is also falling out more than ever. ive done that moisture vs protein test (wetting and pulling a few strands of hair) and my hair doesnt break and mostly takes its shape back which misleadingly seems like its healthy, but it clearly isnt. it is rough to the touch, it looks damaged as if i routinely blast heat on it, and it sounds crunchy when its dry and i grab it. all of that makes me think it needs even more moisture. there is also definitely thinning happening - i can see my scalp way more than i used to, but i dont know when this really started. i've gotten a full blood panel at the doc and have no vitamin deficiencies or anything that would cause hair loss/thinning/damage, but i have read some things online about how deva has caused hair to fall out for others, and given how ive tried literally every deva product on the market to fix this situation and its just gotten worse, im ready to move on to other products. im happy to do a total revamp, all new products, i just feel super overwhelmed though because when i first started curly girl there were so few products you could buy so you either splurged for deva or made stuff at home - now there seems to be so much available but im not sure where to start or what my hair needs. im attaching photos of what my hair used to look like and what it looks like now. here is my current routine:

deva no poo twice a week, and deva one condition 3-4 times a week. i also always use a silicone scalp massaging brush in the shower. after rinsing out 70% of my conditioner with cold water i rake deva b'leave in through soaking wet hair flipped upside down. i then apply either arc angel or ultra defining gel, rake it through, and then gently scrunch with a cotton t shirt. sometimes i use the deva coconut supercream but it really leaves my hair super frizzy. sometimes i plop for 10-15 min after a shower, but only if i want loose curls. my curls are much tighter now if i dont plop (the opposite was true in the southeast). i dont pull my hair back in any tight styles, i don't use any kind of brush or comb (i detangle with fingers in the shower) and i sleep in a satin bonnet. i also use deva buildup buster 1-2 times a month and deva heaven in hair OR deva melt into moisture matcha mask 1-2 times a month. when i deep condition i leave it in for 20-30 minutes before rinsing. i know this isnt everything they make but please trust me when i say my bathroom cabinet is full of every single deva product on the market past and present - this is just the routine ive been doing for the last year or so. what non-deva products do yall recommend for this absolute disaster? also while i appreciate all of you diy angels i am not interested in making things for my hair - im too busy and too

Also conditioner stretches my hair out

Now the detailed version for the people with endless time
So Hi beginner curly girl here I just found out that my hair is over moisturized I thought all this time that I had low porosity hair and I needed to use protein free products and I ordered a bunch of moisturizing hair products . I did the hair strand in a cup of water test and it always floated on the top.. but my hair matches all the symptoms of over moisturized hair : it‚Äôs look fluffy but feels ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and my curl pattern is flat and very weak my hair after washing usually ends up dried without any gel puffy fluffy mostly straightish wavy looking with a few curly strands, the only way I can get it normal looking is by using a ton of gel in this case flaxseed which makes my hair feel really crunchy and dry.

For reference I am caucasian with 2c/3a hair

 I tried to look online for ways to fix this but I am very new to this world and now I‚Äôm just confused after hours of research...
All this time I didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with my hair but I think I just found it.  I also realize when my hair always looks better with my keratin shampoo even though it contain sulfates and it does with sulfate free shampoo that doesn‚Äôt contain any proteins and by the deva curl one condition works so well for me. 
The product I currently have are mostly cantu products and all of them have moisturizing written on them. 
 I‚Äôve bought these, i‚Äôve never used any of these as I just bought them Recently: 
-Cantu Shea butter moisturizing twist and lock gel
-Cantu Color protecting conditioner with quinoa pro tech from the shea butter line
-shea moisture baobab and Tea oil low porosity protein free shampoo (yeah I really messed up with this one üòÖüòÖüòÖ)
-cantu for natural hair complete conditioning co wash
-Born beautiful naturals coconut cream deep conditioner

My hair routine so far included a L‚ÄôOreal sulfate free shampoo or sulfate containing shampoo with keratin for color protection (my hair is dyed black) The deva curl one condition and Flexseed gel with which I had mixed results all the time sometimes it turned out great sometimes it turned out bad. My hair washing usually includes wetting my hair shampooing conditioning brushing my hair with conditioner I just started doing this recently before i used to  untangle my hair with conditioner Rinse conditioner dry with T-shirt I‚Äôve noticed increased results from plopping with a T-shirt for around an hour although I read that this is not particularly good for over moisturized hair and then applying flaxseed gel and drying with a diffuser. 

I have noticed my hair is particularly conditioner sensitive. I haven‚Äôt used conditioner for most of my life up until I started doing the curly girl method as it always left my hair just as frizzy only more moisturized and limp if you know what I mean. I especially have I dislike for drugstore conditioner.. The only conditioner that worked for me so far is the deva curl . It‚Äôs also very hard even this way not to over condition my hair even if I apply a completely normal amount. 

So, I need your help. What products should I buy? Do you guys have any recommendations for Products that would fix the situation and that would maintain my hair being healthy and keep it from being over moisturized and over conditioned. 

Some of the questions I have : should I use a protein treatment if yes which one? Should I use the products I bought, are they any good, or should I buy a new product with a high protein rate? Would using The Cantu products I bought accelerate the damage? Can I use the deep conditioner/any deep conditioner? Should I condition my hair? Should I skip conditioner for the time being and if yes for how long? What is my porosity? What type of shampoo should I use, is Cowash good Or should I stick to sulfate free shampoo ? Should I use the cantu gel I bought or should I keep using flaxseed gel or do you guys have a better recommendation? 
How should I do my hair routine? Should I plop?  I noticed my hair becomes curlier if I do. But I read it‚Äôs not good. 

I know I sound extremely freaked out and I‚Äôm being overdramatic but I‚Äôm really scared that I‚Äôm ruining my hair and using the wrong products may ruin my hair.  I‚Äôm also scared that switching to proteins and proteins treatments it would make my hair break off or fall out I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just confused this is all getting too complicatedüôÅ I don‚Äôt want really want to experiment with my hair and I‚Äôm scared something might go wrong so before I tried I need to be 100% sure that it is safe and will not damage or ruin my hair in any way. Can too much protein or unnecessary protein and protein treatment damage my hair permanently?

on a lighter note anyone got some recommendations for in this case keratin/proteins containing sulfate free shampoo‚Äôs and gel? I think I‚Äôm just going to keep using the diva curl conditioner although it‚Äôs very expensive catch and doesn‚Äôt smell very good but if you have better recommendations Im open to suggestion. 
What about flaxseed gel? Is that over moisturized hair approved?

Just on a note my hair is fine and not over softened if I put flaxseed gel on it so it is hard and crunchy then I crunch it out and it looks fine but only sometimes sometimes especially when I put conditioner on my hair even if it‚Äôs the diva curl my curl pattern stretches out.  I get much better hair without conditioner but that would probably be unsustainable no? Like it would dry out crunchyüòù?

I am a 2c hair male, and recently it has been impossible to style my hair curly. I have been wearing my hair wavy and dry. Just Shampooing it and no conditionor, its looking at its worst, but my skin is clearing up. Conditionor is making my hair very moisturized (Which is a good thing) but this mostouruized hair is also full of oils which causes the acne on my skin.  The issue is my hair when curly falls on my face, its not possible to style my curly hair to the side without ruining the curls. I am just at a point where every curl cream conditions coconut oil which reacts very badly to my skin causing forehead acne (LIKE REALLY BAD) 

**Question**

Anyone here with acne prone skin, how do you wear your hair? How do you deal with your skin while also making your curly hair look beautiful and healthy? I am at the point to choose nice curly hair with bad acne or nice skin with bad hair.

What products do you use that dont contain any oils or coconut oil?

Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie works wonders for my hair but in result has coconut causing the bad skin!

  
r/curlyhair I need your help to find products that are not acne prone but also will do wonders for my 2c curls!

I'm just starting with the CGM but I've had great success with Jessicurl's products (Rockin Ringlets and Spiralicous in particular). The RR is great if you need to emphasise your curls - it works great on its own, and I combine it with the Spiralicious or the DevaCurl Light gel for even more hold. Honestly, RR is my holy grail.

I low-poo with the Shea Moisture weightless shampoo (it's specifically for fine wavy hair). I tried the Shea Moisture conditioners but they all weigh down my hair, so I switched to Garnier Loving blends (not all of their conditioners are CGM-friendly, though).

My hair is coarse and medium thickness, so some of these may not work for you but trial and error is the key.

4741,4,7,2,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/ari77s/waves_fall_flat_after_drying_andor_after_a_long/egndp07/,"My hair after showering and scrunching is usually around 2B to 2C with the occasional 3A curls mixed in, especially in the hair framing my face which aren't bleached. It also looks around the same waviness when I refresh on days I don't shower. The porosity of my hair is about medium highish (hair floats in middle but closer to bottom then top when using the water porosity test). The frizziness and coarseness of my hair has gone down huge amounts since I started the CG method, but I keep having the issue of my hair becoming extremely flat on top and less wavy as it dries and as the day wears on. Any suggestions on how to improve anything??

 Also, bonus question- if I am having a lazy day where I just wanna tie my hair up with a scrunchie or clip, do I still need to refresh my hair? I usually do this the day before I shower and don't put in any product because my hair will feel gross if I do. Will this make my hair more likely to not curl when I do do my refreshing/wash routine?

Routine:

Wash day (currently once a week or when bad build up): I use Suave cleansing shampoo and scrub my scalp. After thoughly cleaning out the grease and build up, I use Mixed Chicks deep conditioning treatment, put my hair into a shower cap, and let it sit for at least 25 minutes. I STC the deep conditioner in first, then gently comb it, then squish more before I put it into the shower cap. Rinse. Then squish in Shea Moisture curl smoothie (pea size amount), shea moisture leave in conditioner Jamaican Black Castor Oil (barely any since a little goes a LONG way), and finally a handful of Jessie's Jelly curls (I may stop using this once I run out as I think it's leaving a weird residue that makes my hair feel wet and oily, plus it doesn't create a cast). Then I scrunch a little water out with a soft tee shirt and then plop until the next morning (I shower at night).

Normal showering (2-3 times a week): same as above except the shampoo is Alaffia baby shampoo and the conditioner is Shea Moisture Smooth &amp; Tame conditioner for frizzy fine hair.

Refreshing (every day minus the day before I shower): Thoughly wet hair with a spray bottle. Squish in Shea Moisture curl smoothie (pea size amount) and a handful of Jessie's Jelly curls.

My mother was born in 1952. I was born in 1979. Only relevant because of attitudes towards hair and the popular styles during the teenage years.

We have the same hair texture, right down to the premature greying. 

I argued with her as a child that my hair was curly, because it was curly when wet. She told me everyone's was when wet, and that we had straight, frizzy poofy hair. I really wanted curly hair. Even did the rag rollers from Little House.

She had her hippie life, and used a clothes iron to iron it straight, or rolled it on huge cans to stretch it straight, or let it do it's thing after she brushed it into frizzed submission.

""Go brush your hair, it looks stringy.""

She paid for a spiral perm for me in 7th grade, and then had me pick it out so much the curls fell completely in three weeks, except for my French poodle bangs. 

Say it louder for the people in the back: when you treat curly hair like it's straight, it'll kinda look straight and kinda like crap. Naturally curly hair takes some effort to look good. (Unless you're a guy, apparently, where you can use bar dial soap as shampoo and have coils like 90s Andy McDowell).

Not your Mother's 3-1 Conditioner as Leave-in,

Plump for Joy spray to SOTC.

I typically have a lot of fly aways for 2nd day hair, so if there's anything I can change about my routine or my sleeping routine, let me know!

My routine:

\- First I condition with DevaCurl's One Condition Delight, but I'm switching to Pantene Come Clean because I believe that doesn't have protein in it.

\- I put Shea Moisture's Coconut and Hibiscus Styling Milk in my hair. I just comb it through with my head/hair upside down.

I have 2b/2c hair and have been following the curly girl method since september 2018, no matter what I do my hair never looks right. Recently it has actually gotten worse despite no changes to my routine. 
I've always had a difficult relationship with my hair but have stuck to the CGM because I want to not hate it. 

My routine is as follows:
‚Ä¢ I wash my hair every 3 days
‚Ä¢ I apply/rinse out products with my hair upside down
‚Ä¢ shampoo with shea moisture argan oil and almond milk smooth and tame shampoo
‚Ä¢ apply cantu hydrating cream conditioner and detangle with a wide tooth comb
‚Ä¢ let the conditioner sit in my hair while I wash my body 
‚Ä¢ squish to condish before rinsing out
‚Ä¢ when out the shower scrunch in cantu hair mousse and cantu moisturising curl activator cream
‚Ä¢ apply gel cast with ECO curl and wave styling gel
 ‚Ä¢ plop hair with t-shirt for 20 minutes to an hour
‚Ä¢ put metal clips at the roots and let air dry
‚Ä¢ I have a satin pillow case and will either sleep with my hair in a pineapple (tied with a scrunchie) or in a satin bonnet
‚Ä¢ occasionally will spray hair with palmers coconut dry oil mist 24 hours before I wash my hair if it's really dry

Despite being white, I use cantu products because my hair is always really dry and frizzy. For some reason my hair quality has gone down and my curl pattern is deforming. It's gotten to a point where I never want to wear my hair down, I either tie it up with a scrunchie or wear a bandana because my top layer always looks straight and the lower layers aren't curling as nicely anymore :(

I've been struggling through the CGM for 6 months. I have a story like many others here, spent the first 39 years of my life not realizing how wavy/curly my hair was (2B/2C); I just thought it was frizzy and puffy and awful so I blew it out and/or smoothed it with a flat iron pretty much my whole life.

I say I've been struggling with CGM because it's just so much damn work and I sometimes hate all the effort it takes! I wash my hair upside down, squish to condish, usually get my nose and ears full of water in the process, carefully apply multiple product to my soaking wet hair with praying hands and/or roping, plop, diffuse upside down, which takes forever, then spend the rest of the day struggling to not touch my hair. I've also spent a lot of money trying a ton of different products. Many didn't work out at all and the ones that did, all work pretty much the same; I've not found my ""HG"" or anything that's even remotely better than the rest.

But I keep doing it because when I have a good hair day, I love my curls and I much prefer it to how I looked when blowing my hair out. 

Well today I just didn't feel like doing my whole lengthy routine so I washed and conditioned my hair right side up like I used to, wrapped it in a regular old towel when I got out of the shower, just scrunched in a little gel after I had towel dried out and then went outside for a walk with my wet hair on a windy day. It should have been a recipe for disaster but you know what? *My hair looked pretty much the same as when I slave over my routine!* It was a tiny bit more frizzy and had a tiny bit less volume but honestly it still looked ok. 

On one hand, I'm kind of pissed off that all the work I've been putting in apparently isn't making any difference. On the other hand, I'm kind of excited that I might be able to get away with such an easy routine.

It‚Äôs been very gradual a change - I didn‚Äôt even notice it at first until there was already a significant decline in my hair‚Äôs ability to curl up properly.

Part of that WAS damage from chemical dye jobs and overall neglect; but after several haircuts (both minor trims and major chops), protein masks, and bond repair treatments (olaplex 3 and 6) - my hair is now healthiest it‚Äôs ever been but still doing this weird ass thing where about 70% of the bottom layers are loose waves and the top layers are big loose curls (2c, MAYBE 3a in some parts.)

It‚Äôs annoying because there isn‚Äôt anything cohesive about this texture, my hair is mostly straight ish wavy with SOME curls.

I have come to believe it‚Äôs probably because of hormonal changes I sustained over 5 years of having the Mirena IUD (got it removed almost 2 months ago specifically because it had severe side effects indicative of hormonal imbalance.)

I know if it‚Äôs hormonal there‚Äôs likely nothing I can do besides wait and hope my hair might bounce back to some type of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù texture and curl pattern, but I just feel so desperate and wanted to see if anyone had any advice they could extend :( I have always loved my curls and I just want them back!!!

4317,7,0,6,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/a8vm2q/what_would_you_say_is_my_wave_pattern_anyone_with/ece65qr/,"So I'm starting to figure out how to deal with my hair to keep it minimally frizzy. Here is my current routine:

1) detangle hair and massage scalp before shower

2) wash hair with Acure Mega Moisture Shampoo (love this!!!!- so gentle, hair feels clean but not squeaky, smells amazing)

2) condition with deva curl one condition delight. I just condition normally, a big handful for each side of hair and kind of scrunch it in

3) rinse out everything 

4) squeeze out excess water and put it in an Aquis turban for like 45-60 min - its in basically a low bun position, if I put it upside down on top of my head my waves get stringy and frizzy 

5) scrunch in gel- currently Im using Biotera Alcohol Free gel that you can get at Sally's. I like it but it's nothing special 

So if I let my hair mostly dry within the towel, when I take it out there's no frizz. If I apply gel when it's damp, I get better hold, definition, and frizz control than if it's wet. 


So just wondering if anyone has a similar hair pattern and what products you use!! My main concerns are definition and frizz control :)

27200,1,2,3,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/a3gvh5/kinda_frustrated/,"kinda frustrated?i've been following a vaguely cg similar routine since about, idk, 2009? i know the book was published the year after but iirc some info re: silicones and heat treatment beforehand. anyway, for years, i washed with a silicone free but sls based shampoo every 3 days, rinsed my hair with vinegar, and called it good. my hair was very healthy and looked *fabulous*. it had great bouncy waves and held pretty much all day, all by itself. this is despite the fact that i brutalized it twice a year or so with chemical hair dye.

then i fucked it up with straight african black soap in about 2014 (the follies of youth) bc i thought washing less would make it even curlier and ""the curlier, the better"" has been my hair motto since at least 2006. the soap preserved my curls but made my hair all straw-y, so i went back to whatever i was using before and it's never been the same. my hair went from more of a 2c to a 2b. anyway, i am aware that curls can loosen with age but this seems to have been centered around my misadventure with the soap.

i have made my routine increasingly curly girl as the years have gone by and some of the changes made my hair better (dropping sls, using conditioner + honey as leave in, deep conditioning). i finally dropped all sulfates recently, and there's been no difference. i'm gonna give my new shampoo another couple weeks before i go look for another brand, but i'm just frustrated.

It's great because you can pick whatever texture/length that you want.  It's also nice to be able to manipulate it however you want and not have to worry about damaging your own hair.

 I'm still struggling to deal and find a new routine. 

Is this... looking okay? Should I have it cut in a more shapely manner? I feel like despite the curliness it lacks buoyancy or volume or... something. 

Routine is: conditioner washed w/Suave Naturals, Olaplexed every couple of weeks, and scrunched moderately with about a dime size dollop of cheap Dep Flex-Hold gel, and finally air dried. 

I had about 2C mostly (floppy big curls) and now it's like... 3A/B? Ish? Sharpie sized curls more or less. And with a TON of frizz it never had before. It's a fairly radical change in texure and I'm often irked by it. I hate heat processing it but I often do that or braid it.

I've done a pile of research here (thanks for this excellent sub), YouTube, Google, etc. Here's my confusion. For every product or routine, somebody swears by it and someone else hates it. It seems to me that a big factor in that might be porosity. Folks often specify their curl type, but fewer mention porosity. 

My issue: I think I'm medium porosity. I don't think I've ever seen anyone say that. So many products seem to be aimed at fixing the extremes, but I don't want to waste a lot of money on stuff that's really likely to be too much me.

So am I missing the point? Is ""keep trying"" the best approach? Can some experienced folks make any suggestions?

There are many causes to breakage, so I can redirect you to this video by an actual curly hairstylist who is so helpful: [video](https://youtu.be/CklBqZYME8E) 

There are days ‚Äî even on my wash days ‚Äî where I just want to wear my hair up. When I use the traditional hair tie and tightly wrap it around my curls in a ponytail (which I did daily for almost an entire school year), my curls were very stretched out when they were pulled back.

I‚Äôm honestly not sure if there was any damage. I‚Äôve been deep conditioning more and falling in love with my silk bonnet and the DevaCurl products lately. They seem to help, but everyone is different. 

Nowadays, I use scrunchies in my hair because they don‚Äôt tangle through my 3A/3B curls. I only tie them once, or maybe twice around my hair loosely. My curl pattern was pretty screwed up, but I‚Äôm taking better care of my hair now. It‚Äôs define you gotten a glow-up. 

I‚Äôm new to this sub, so I hope I helped. Idk your hair curl and whatnot, but just know that not all routines and such works for everyone. Good luck, fellow curlie :)

Edit; okay, yes I have damaged my curls with the ponytail indirectly. I slept with the ponytail, so the backside of my head is straighter hair, possibly wavy, and needs more tlc. The stretched out curls also made this worse. My bonnet has helped the sleeping issue. For you, I would research how to bring your curls back to how you want them.

I have tried bounce curl products before and I really enjoyed the conditioner as well as the the moisturizing shampoo. My hair is probably 2A to 3A Texture wise, I can go from waves to ringlets depending on what I use and what the weather is like. Right now it‚Äôs very hot and humid here. It‚Äôs very hard for me to get good clumping and definition. Anyway my routine today was cleansing with the bounce curl clarifying shampoo which I also tried for the first time and I really like it, (clarifying has made a huge difference for me) then I used the bounce curl conditioner and squished it in. I rinsed 3/4 of it out and used the new bounce curl leave in conditioner which I finger combed through my hair. My hair was soaking wet when I did this. Then I took about two quarter sized dollops of the new curl cream and squished that in. I glazed over that with two quarter sized dollops of the biotera gel from Sally‚Äôs because no gel in my hair on a hot July day is insanity and I didn‚Äôt want to take the risk of having to do my hair over. I did not use as much gel as I normally do though. My hair is so incredibly soft and doesn‚Äôt even feel like it has any product in it and I got the best definition and some really beautiful ringlets. I‚Äôm really liking these products, I have a shoe tree of hair stuff on the back of my bathroom door so I try a lot of different things and this is the best thing I‚Äôve tried in the last couple of years.

2730,5,2,4,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/fxs402/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/fn75yto/,"I‚Äôm new to this thread, I used to get ringlets up until a couple years ago ( I tried looking up the type online and I‚Äôm debating whether it was 2c or 3a) and I never did anything special. Now my hair barely curls at the ends (kind of like a 2a). After browsing through the CG guide (tried skimming but obviously didn‚Äôt read the whole thing), I think my hair has low porosity and I might possibly be protein deficient. I came to the conclusion my hair has low porosity because I‚Äôve tried quite a bit of the products CG guide recommended (both for low porous and porous hair), but a lot of the times it just built up and my hair was disgusting after (I think I‚Äôm also one of the lucky ones where my hair doesn‚Äôt get super dry in general). I skimmed through the protein section and the pictures/ description seemed pretty accurate. But it kind of seems like porosity and protein generally have an inverse relationship (like the higher the porosity, the more prone to protein deficiency)? So I‚Äôm really not sure. 

I always used random conditioner and random leave-ins that weren‚Äôt CG approved. But now my hair seems like it‚Äôs just weighed down but wanting to curl. I‚Äôve tried deep cleansing my hair and using super light products but nothing seems to work now. I‚Äôm 24 so no big hormone changes have happened. I‚Äôve been on BC since I was 18, but I don‚Äôt think my hair texture started changing until much later (unless it takes years to change once on BC). I am on immunosuppressants though, so I don‚Äôt know if that effects hair type or not ( my hair was already getting less curly before taking the immunosuppressants but idk if the medications can contribute). I‚Äôve also tried changing up my hair cuts, but nothing seems to be working. Shorter layers seem to make my hair less curly now than longer layers.

33768,7,0,6,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/buf27d/locking_in_moisture_2c3a_high_porosity_mediumfine/,"Locking in moisture - 2c/3a high porosity medium-fine hairI have read tons about how you have to hydrate your curls and then lock in the moisture. 

My hair is high porosity, dries very fast, so all the hydration I put into it is gone by the end of the day (I wash in the morning). 

Day 2 hair for me is usually very dry, and even if I refresh, scrunch and use a product, it still looks frizzy and messy, plus the roots get even straighter, the curls start only from around the top of my ear down.

I haven't figured out what kind of product should I use to lock in the moisture - butters and oils are too heavy for my hair, so they weigh it down, I tried using just a tiny little bit of olive oil in my palms, scrunching into the ends of dry hair, but it ended up looking greasy and stringy. Using just the cream above didn't help either, it felt like my hair just soaked up all the product and it virtually disappeared, resulting in dryness in a couple of hours. Applying more results in 'heavy hair'.

Any product recommendations? Or maybe I am doing a product application technique in an incorrect way? Any info or recommendation is appreciated!

I am about 3 months into CGM. So far I know that I‚Äôm high porosity, with fine but dense wavy hair. I do have it professionally highlighted 3-4 times per year. I think I‚Äôm around 2b on the top layers, but based on the fact that my hair is fairly hard to straighten (needs a very hot flat iron to get it smooth), I think I‚Äôm supposed to be a 2c? I am easily over moisturized and my hair needs protein. I did my first olaplex 3 treatment this week. In a few weeks I‚Äôll need to buy shampoo again and I‚Äôm not sure what to get. This is my current routine:
Normal wash day:
Everyone balance shampoo and conditioner with some extra protein (I‚Äôve liked plain yogurt and I have some braggs amino acids to try). I have tried a LOT of stylers and currently I‚Äôm doing jessicurl rockin ringlets and spiralicious. I like them the best so far. I scrunch water out with a cotton towel before the gel. Then I diffuse until it‚Äôs dry or I get tired of it. At some point I usually put root clips in. 
Every week to ten days I clarify with kinky curly cc and then do a protein treatment. Every other time I do a deep condition before the protein. I also pre poo with the jessicurl scalp oil on clarify days because my scalp is getting dry. 
I have tried mop top custard and Leave in conditioner. All my curl falls out. I also tried jessicurl aloeba and similar results. I live in the southern us so humidity is a major factor for me. I‚Äôve considered ordering bounce curl to try or innersense, but I‚Äôm really not sure! I chatted with an innersense stylist and she recommended the color treated line, but I don‚Äôt see it on any approved lists.

You can do a test online and figure out if you have wavy, straight or curly hair. I think the more curl you have, the higher the number (3b etc) SOTC is scrunch out the crunch - after applying products and your hair is dry sometimes there is a cast on your hair so you can scrunch out the crunch to get soft curls. Plopping is what curlies do when their hair is wet, out of the shower etc. I plop for about 30 minutes. Basically it‚Äôs plopping your hair on top of your head in a cotton tshirt or a microfiber towel to soak up some moisture and encourage your curl pattern. STC is squish to condish and it means applying conditioner when your hair is soaking wet and the scrunching your hair so that moisture really gets in there.

32128,5,7,6,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/fpy7yh/trouble_finding_a_techniquemethod_that_really/,"Trouble finding a technique/method that really works for my hair. My hair sticks all together and takes any kind of movement/manipulation very badly! Please help!&amp;#x200B;

I've googled my issue to death but can't find an answer to this!

My hair for some reason can't be flipped upside down or even really go side to side. I see videos of people turning their heads at all angles while conditioning/applying products/plopping with ease--their hair just magically goes in the direction they turn their head.

When I do it, my hair immediately tangles and becomes stringy. I cant do my routine upside down to encourage volume because when i try to plop or turn right side up it is a rats nest. I have also found that I can't scrunch at **any point** in the process because it makes it frizzy and destroys the clumps. It's just like my hair all sticks together and wants to stay that way.

It has just left me really unsatisfied with my hair. Its flat and limp and frizzy. I'll try to include a picture in the comments. 

**Anyone else have similar hair, and what have you done to improve your routine? I would really like to have more volume/body without making frizz and stringiness. Thanks!**

My hair I think is 2b/2c and very fine, with fragile curls. 

Products: 

* cowash with cozykids cowash (was on clearance at target and seems to work!)
* clarify biweeklyish with nym honey and melon shampoo or deeply moisturizing tale and mane
* condish with shae moisture restore and repair
* leave-in is shae moisture Jamaican black castor oil (i thought it would be too heavy for my hair but it doesn't seem to be causing any issues.)
* volumizing sauve mousse (I've tried gels but they make my hair feel dry and very tangly)

I do all this right side up with gentle praying hands, and try to encourage curls/clumping by pressing the ends of my hair into my scalp. No scrunching!

I comb my hair with the denman brush after the leave in and mousse for product distribution. Seems to make the mousse work better. I've tried sectioning my hair and combing individual clumps but because of these issues I can't manage to grab one clump without surrounding hairs and clumps going with it and its just a mess! 

Thanks again!

25212,4,7,5,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/bjjf9t/more_protein_more_moisture_what_should_i_do/,"More protein, more moisture??? What should I do?Hi there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping someone could help me and maybe give some tips. I'm growing out my hair, but I'm not really happy with how it is atm. 

As you can see in the pictures, my hair gets pretty frizzy. I don't even mind it as it is in the pictures, but it gets worse during the day. Most times it won't last until the evening. A 2nd hairday isn't even an option. My hair feels quite soft, and I think it's hydrated well enough. Maybe I should use a protein treatment? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure I've got high porosity hair, so I use a LOC + gel method. 

&amp;#x200B;

Routine: (all products CG approved) 

&amp;#x200B;

1. co-wash with local/cheap conditioner with coconut oil in it. 

I leave the tiniest bit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Then I dry by gently pressing with a micro-fiber towel. Hair is too short to either plop or crunch... 

&amp;#x200B;

3. I then apply a tiny bit of olive oil, as I think my high-porosity hair benefits from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Just the tiniest amount and gently rub that in my hair in a backwards motion. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Then I apply a light gel, the same as the fourth step. I use two finger tops. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Air dry for minimally two hours and then scrunch out the crunch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really, really hate the air drying part. It looks absolutely ridiculous  before I can scrunch out the crunch. That's why I don't like too much product. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank's a lot in advance!!!

19792,5,7,0,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/8r1qlk/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_jun_14_2018/e0qot0b/,"I'm struggling with my hair so hard lately!

Background: went CG in 2010, used Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus starter kit (before they changed the ingredients) and my hair was looking beautiful. I washed every 2-3 days. After about 2 years of no heat I started straightening my hair again, maybe like once every 3 weeks. After like 2 years of this I noticed my hair wasn't looking its best so I scaled down the straightening to once every 2 months. My hair has not gone back to it's former glory ever since. I suffered from two instances in 2016 and in 2018 where I was losing hair in chunks every time I washed it. I believe it was due to a vitamin D deficiency which has since been taken care of, but my hair is still looking so bad!

Issues I'm having: my hair is noticeably thinner and has lost some of it's curl definition. I had mostly 3a and 3b curls, but now its 2c and 3a. I don't really know what caused this change in hair type. I'm not on hormonal birth control, haven't been pregnant. Aside from the vitamin D deficiency I really don't know what has caused my hair to be so thin and limp now. 

The two things I struggle with the most are greasy hair and tangled ends. it's unreal how oily my scalp becomes the day after I wash my hair. I've tried clarifying shampoos, moisturizing shampoos, co washing, and nothing seems to work. I used to be able to go 3-4 days without a shampoo, and now I can't go more than 2 days without my hair becoming an oil slick. The rest of my hair still feels kind of dry though, especially the ends which get tangled up the most. I've pretty much just accepted having tangled hair but I miss how soft and shiny my curls used to be.

My routine: I alternate between the LCO and LOC method. I believe I'm low porosity but I think LOC works better for me. I wash my hair every other day, I finger detangle and use a tangle teezer type brush in the shower. I use the sandwich method to apply my hair products in the order listed below on soaking wet hair, and mostly on the ends. I scrunch out excess moisture and product with a microfiber towel. I air dry and pineapple my hair at night and sleep on a satin pillowcase.

* carol's daughter sweet ginger cleansing rinse-every other day
* carol's daughter moroccan pear conditioner-every other day
* kinky curly knot today leave in-on wash day
* scotch porter beard oil-on wash day to seal
* as i am twist defining cream-on wash day
* curls goddess curl botanical gelle-on wash day
* alikay naturals curl refresher-daily 

I'm so stuck on what to do. I've tried following so many different routines geared towards low porosity and high porosity but neither seem to work. I feel like I buy so many products that are too heavy for my hair now, but my hair doesn't seem to like those jelly type products either. It seems like they just sit on top of my hair.

I feel like I follow the CG routine perfectly and my hair still doesn't look great. And it used to which is what bothers me about the whole thing. what am I doing wrong? /: i'm open to any suggestions on products or styling tips.

A question I haven‚Äôt found much info about is transitioning from baking soda and vinegar routines to CGM. My hair care routine for my coarse 2C (I think?) hair for the past 8 years has been baking soda and vinegar once a week (and sometimes a water wash mid-week), styled with homemade flax seed gel. The only times I‚Äôve used shampoo and conditioner is when I‚Äôve gotten haircuts (3-4 times a year) or gone to a pool/beach (again, only a few times a year). So I‚Äôm wondering (1) Do I need to shampoo with sulfates as a reset? (2) Do others have transition stories like mine to share?
I bought ShearMoisture Moisture Retention conditioner to try out, and when I used it by-the-book with the CGM for waves, followed by my homemade flax gel, my hair was much smoother than usual, but the curls turned out limper. I‚Äôm seeing that lighter products and/or protein treatments can help with this, but I‚Äôm really not sure what to try next.

I found that the way she cut and layered my hair, since it was done based on my actual hair texture, really helped things bounce up and my curls (waves) become more uniform. 

Regardless of how you get your hair cut though, don't be worried if your hair refuses to curl for a couple of weeks! Mine had horrible scissor shock so it was much straighter than usual (1c/2a), but now I'm getting my usual 2b/2c waves with more definition, better volume, and more movement.

Also (sorry this is basically a novel at this point), i found that the way my hair was styled at the salon made me super unsure about my haircut since I prefer my hair super clumpy even if I'm sacrificing volume, vs the curl specialist who used the rake and shake method which gave me much smaller clumps but tons of volume. So if you do decide to go the curly cut route, it definitely pays to keep in mind that the way the stylist styles your hair may be different from how you prefer your hair styled.

I've got 4A/4C curls that are harder to manage at the roots and needs all the moisture on this Earth and I've found them to be a fantastic one and done solution.

I used their Coconut Hair Smoothie and it was great, it could have been better, but I was fresh off DevaCurl and I was jaded and angry so it probably is better than I'm giving it credit for. I liked it enough to head back to Marshall's to stock up. I didn't find it but I did find their Hair Sorbet. Tried it today and I'm fucking impressed! 

She suuuuuuper thick. Like, stupid thick. I have hair to my ass and I probably used 3 tablespoons of product, max. Other than my problem dry area on my fringe, (thanks DevaCurl!üôÑ) it looks so gooooood. The slippage was in point and I got minimal frizz when I fluffed it out and broke the cast. 

I'm also head over heals for Carol's Daughter (four. day. hair. Say what!) But that works best on wash day hair, not run of the mill weekday hair.

9001,6,7,0,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/988n6h/success_ft_a_new_technique/e4e5kl9/,"Had a hair success today! 

So I had a haircut a few months ago that chopped off my 3b spirals and I was left with about 2b-2c waves instead. Decided to treat my hair as wavy and followed some new people on Instagram with wavy hair - which is how I found this new (to me) technique. 

PowerDomi on Instagram introduced me to something called a pulsing technique. Basically you apply your products by pushing it into your hair. Not scrunching or raking, but basically separating your hair into two sections and grabbing them with product in your hands. (I can link her post if anyone would like it). 

Today I: shampooed and conditioned with Shea Moisture‚Äôs fruit infused coconut water weightless line. For the conditioner I flipped over my head and rinsed all of it out to form clumps (after I had detangled with a denman). After clumps were formed I used the pulsing technique to distribute in Giovanni Cosmetics‚Äô weightless direct leave in conditioner followed by Kinky Curly Curling Custard. After I had pulsed them in I began to scrunch. Then scrunched in a little Ouidad climate control gel. Diffused about 50%. Added a little more ouidad. Clipped my roots and let dry. Then scrunched out the crunch with a little argan oil. 

Really happy with these results! Got some of my tighter spirals back!

So, without really knowing what the heck I wad doing, I went to ulta on Sunday and splurged quite a bit, but now I likely have to go through all the ingredients and make sure they're kosher. 

I purchased:

Redken super soft shampoo
Redken super soft conditioner

Ouidad curl quencher (curl cream)
Ouidad vita curl (mousse)

It's a 10 (leave in)

Redken all soft mega (leave in conditioner)

And redken soft hold hairspray 

After reading up on three CG method, I feel like I have to return all of them. 


I would love thoughts on whether any of you have used the Ouidad brand as anything past Organix is braille to me. 

I just looked up the redken shampoo/ conditioner ingredients and I think I'm out of luck on that already. 

I would love recommendations on what you use and what you think my curl type is as well/ anyone who has it and what they recommend. I'm thinking it's 2c-3a but I am but a young grasshopper who knows nothing as of right now. 

Also, when you take a shower and DON'T wash your hair, what do you do with it? I can't stand my hair getting frizzy to all hell, I deal with it, but feel like it looks like crap the whole day... but I also can't stand simply putting water on it but not washing it! It doesn't smell like a meadow of flowers with just water and that makes me incredibly sad. 

If you keep it dry, what's your routine for after shower dry hair care? 

Do you put product in every day or only on the days you wash your hair? 

I read that there are ""cleaning conditioners"" that should be used in place of shampoo for the most part, what ones do you guys use?

New to CGM-started with a reset wash in mid June. As well as I can figure out I have 2A-2C waves, (probably) low porosity, dense hair. It is long and layered and tends to be extremely dry and frizzy. 

Current routine: 

Alternate DevaCurl Low Poo or Cowash with NYM Naturals Blue Sea Kale &amp; Coconut Water
Condition with same NYM Naturals conditioner
Finger detangle
S2C and rinse out conditioner
While soaking wet squish in a dime size amount of same conditioner to hydrate waves
Squish in handful of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel
Soak up excess water and scrunch with t-shirt
Plop for 10-20 minutes and air dry
SOTC
Deep condition every Friday with conditioner mixed with honey and olive oil

For refresh: wet hair with spray bottle until very damp and scrunch in small amount of conditioner emulsified with water. Follow with Cantu Wave Whip mousse.

I have also tried Cantu Curl Activator and DevaCurl One Condition. The Cantu weighed down my hair and did not absorb properly and the conditioner was good but didn't seem hydrating enough and is expensive. 

Primary concerns: my hair feels dry and looks very frizzy despite using cowashing for the first time ever and using more moisturizing products. I can't get a strong hold in my waves and they end up appearing stringy when I do. Looking for ways to increase hydration, definition, and decrease frizz!

It's a variety) hair, and it used to get pretty... let's call it voluminous. I'd been using a bunch of conditioner and no shampoo for a long time, but upgraded to NYM curl defining (love it) and found this sub. I've been conditioning 2x week, detangling with a wooden comb and letting the conditioner soak under a cap for at least half an hour, rinsing, and scrunching some conditioner back in before wrapping it in a tshirt for a bit.


Last time I forgot to scrunch the conditioner in and rinsed too much out, and poof! Back to how it was 3 bottles of conditioner ago. Tried again today (because I've gotten used to how nice it looks now- kinda feels like what they're saying about people getting so used to contour makeup or snapchat filters no longer being happy with their own faces), making sure I put some conditioner back, and it worked! Better definition and it looks less angry! 


Now I'm wondering just how much better it could get if I tried a decent gel- not usually a fan bc I used to touch my hair a lot, but I've trained myself out of it, and if it gets my curls to that extra boost, I'm sold.

It can take hours to dry, which is a problem because if i sleep on it wet, it flattens, and if i want to shower before work it's still wet when i get there.

My process:

Paul Mitchell clarifying shampoo (i have very hard water, so i really can't skip shampooing)

Paul Mitchell hydrating conditioner, brush, scrunch, rinse

Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner, scrunch, light rinse, scrunch

Handful of garneir fructis mousse, scrunch

Towel scruch my hair to stop dripping

Kitchen strainer dry my hair with blow dryer (its an old hair dryer i got from my parents when i was in middle school, to give an idea of how old this thing is my parents chose between the pink polka dot style it is and one with Justin Bieber's face on it)

Usually this only gets it about 1/2-3/4 dry before my arms scream ""NO MORE!!"" So then i leave it to air dry, occasionally scrunching.

I work 11 hr days so i don't always have time/energy to mess with my hair that long or wait long enough to go to bed.

For the record, my hair started off as 2a, fine, high po, medium density but now I'm 2c/2b and medium po. I will also say that I'm 9 months in and I only found that I started getting major results a couple of months ago. It took a VERY long time.  


* My favorite shampoo is Pacifica Pineapple. 
* My favorite conditioners are PAcifica Pineapples and V05 Strawberries and Milk (I like this one better but it makes my head a bit itchy so I don't use it as much).
* I never use leave in. I had to wet plop in a shower cap for the first 6 months and now can plop dry or wet. 
* I like Kinky Curly Curling Custard for a curl enhancer. I only dip the very tip of my finger in and use it for half of my hair and then do the same on the other side. I apply soaking wet. 
* I dry plop or I went plop for a bit and then micro plop as much water out as possible. I apply product onto damp hair and diffuse. 
* I rope in Pantene Curls mousse and sometimes I use flaxseed gel, but not always

Sometimes I diffuse, sometimes I don't.

 it gets quite greasy so i have to use shampoo when washing or it just drips in grease. i use shea mostiure shampoo and some kind of miracle coconut conditioner that i forgot the name of, as i only bought it last week (it was on sale, ok?)

i normally tie my hair in half up, half downs, plaits (one or two unless going to sleep) a loose bun or a ponytail. i can‚Äôt really wear my hair down as it gets too greasy. the only problem, and something that has plagued me since childhood, is that my baby hairs act like they are trying to get a signal from space. i use hairspray to keep it down, but by the end of the day, there is more hair OUTSIDE the hairbobbin then in it.

5980,4,0,5,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/chw1dd/protein_products_frizz/euygnzp/,"Hi! I‚Äôve been following the CGM for about 3 weeks now and I am absolutely loving the improvements in my hair so far! I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to tame the frizz in my low porosity 2B/2C hair and was looking into the protein/moisture balance since noticing that the presence of glycerin in my products doesn‚Äôt effect my hair to the degree I originally believed (I live in a hot and humid area). 

My hair often feels a little too soft and I‚Äôve noticed my waves falling out by the end of the day and my hair becoming flat and limp despite using gels. I know hair doesnt stay perfect all day, but I included some photos taken 7ish hours apart. I did the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt Hydrate and Repair Protein Power Treatment two days ago, which smells amazing but leaves my hair reaaaallly moisturized and doesn‚Äôt seem to do much protein wise. I also have a ton of wet frizz. I tried the rice water rinse by boiling the rice around a week ago and didnt notice much of a difference, however, it did dry out small sections of my hair- maybe I didn‚Äôt prep the rice water correctly? I was looking into the ApHogee 2 minute treatment and even looking into Olaplex no 3 to see if maybe I dont need protein, but a bond repair. I‚Äôm still trying to understand the current state of my hair and I don‚Äôt want to push it into protein overload. 

I use the Not Your Mothers Curl Talk styling cream (which has protein) and the DevaCurl Ulta Defining Gel (also has protein). I recently (two days ago) switched over to using the NYM CT Mousse to see if maybe the cream was too heavy for my hair along with the Jessicurl Spiralicious Gel to see if removing Glycerin would help combat my frizz issue (which it does for a while, then it frizzes up as time progresses).  I know that sounds like a lot of styling products- but I only use 2 at a time to prevent my hair from being weighed down and have played with the amount of each product with no success.

If your hair is dry, you can try putting conditioner in your hair before washing, then washing as normal and applying either rinse out condition or going directly to a leave-in conditioner, again depending on how much conditioning your hair needs. You can add the pre-treatment to the lengths of your hair or just the ends, whatever works.

I would ditch the natural oils and butters in the routine as they can weigh down fine and/or wavy hair, not to mention they can feed the fungus that causes seborrheic dermatitis. If you like the way oils feel, try mineral oil (baby oil without added ingredients). It's safe for SD, doesn't build up and is easily washed out of the hair. Plus, it's cheap, adds frizz control and helps prevent moisture loss. It only takes a very small amount, a couple of drops on the ends, for instance.

I would switch out the gel for one without a drying alcohol. Giovanni has a strong hold gel, the L.A. Hold gel. I like ecostyle-I believe the clear one called Krystal is oil-free, LA Looks Nutra Curl has a small amount of avocado oil, As I Am Curling Jelly is oil free, the suave max hold sculpting gel is oil free, Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic is oil free. There are lots of other options if none of those seems appealing.

I would stop plopping wet hair for any extended period of time as this can also worsen the SD. My scalp problems actually improved years ago when I starting blow drying my hair instead of air drying. My scalp does not like being wet for long periods of time, it gets flaky and mad. Diffusing my hair also helps with increased and prolonged curl definition. My hair is everywhere from 2c-3c, fine/medium strands, medium high density, normal to low porosity.

I would look for a deep conditioner with zero or minimal oil and butters, or look for mineral oil as the oil in the product. I believe Not Your Mothers Naturals has a couple of those that are also CG-friendly. I have heard good things about their Matcha Green Tea and Wild Apple Blossom mask in the green tub. It has almond oil, but that tends to be a lighter oil, and again, it's towards the middle of the ingredients list. They have packets of other NYM deep conditioners on Ulta.com, and it looks like the Activated Bamboo Charcoal &amp; Purple Moonstone Restore &amp; Reclaim Butter Masque, the Passion Fruit Kombucha &amp; Awapuhi Ginger Youth Revival Butter Masque and the Blue Sea Kale &amp; Pure Coconut Water Sea Mineral Butter Masque are all oil free.

Look for a lighter leave-in conditioner as well. Again, Not Your Mothers has some options, Giovanni has two that I like, the Direct Leave-in and the Vitapro Fusion Protective Moisture treatment. The Giovanni products do have an oil, sunflower oil, which tends to be lighter, and the oil is towards the middle of the ingredient list, so may not be as bothersome.

37448,5,7,2,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/a8hwof/help_with_a_few_questions/,"Help with a few questions?Hi everyone!  I'm at the start of my CG journey, and I'd like to ask a few questions (I've read most of the FAQ and the beginners routine).

Here's a few things about my hair: it's very dense (can barely see my scalp), low porosity (hair floats for hours in water), and the strands are either medium or thick (I can't decide).  It's between 4in (back/sides) and 7in (top).  I have 3b or 3c type hair?  [Here's some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/DGhQ19z)

So I only recently found out that I have curly hair.  Before, I would shower every day and use a dandruff fighting clarifying shampoo with sulfates in it, followed by a conditioner with sulfates.  I always rinsed out everything (without scrubbing my scalp), and didn't let it sit for more than a few seconds.  Since I started growing my hair out, my hair doesn't dry as fast as it use to, so I got a blow dryer.  I would use the medium heat on high blow setting, and run my hands through my hair to dry my scalp and everything as quick as possible.

This routine leaves my hair happy for a day, minus some very mild dandruff.  But by the second day, my hair becomes very oily and smells awful.  It also makes my hair very poofy, with a strong wave patten.

I decided to try part of the CG beginner routine to see if it helped my bad smell, dandruff, or second day oilyness.  I skipped the clarifying shampoo because I already used one every day.  I bought some TRESemme Botanique Conditioner and starting co-washing with that exclusively for the past few days.  I then use it to condition and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing.  I haven't used it as a leave in yet.  To dry I started plopping for 15 minutes with a cotton t-shirt, and using a diffuser on medium heat low blow setting.  The whole process takes about an hour (as opposed to 30 minutes previously).

Doing this routine revealed to me that I don't have wavy hair like I thought, but loads of curls!  That surprised me honestly.  It's also slightly reduced my dandruff, and hasn't made the oilyness any worse (which I was worried from not using a shampoo and only co-washing).  But after 24 hours my scalp is still starting to smell pretty bad.  I can smell it on my glasses when I smell the part resting on my ear.

I've had my friend check my scalp for any redness or large dandruff flakes (to see if this is seb derm), but they said they couldn't see anything and thought it looked relatively healthy.  

Now that I got all that out of the way, here are my questions:

1. Should I expect CG to reduce the smell of my scalp any?  I've read that it's probably caused by over production of hair oil from using sulfate shampoo too often.  I've only been on this light CG routine for about a week.
2. (Dumb question) Should I see a dermatologist about my scalp?  My dandruff is really light and only small white flakes.  I'm just worried about the dandruff + smelly hair oils meaning I might have sep derm.
3. Can I keep good curls without using gel?  I shower at night, so I would love to go to bed after drying my hair and wake  up with similar curls.  [Here's the same pictures](https://imgur.com/a/DGhQ19z) as before.  The top one is right after I shower.  The bottom one is after work the next day (I did a side part).  The bottom one is roughly 24 hours after showering. 
4. How in the world do I use gel?? I tried using it last night.  Plopping made my hair stick straight to my head, and diffusing seemed to do literally nothing in terms of drying.  After an hour it felt like it hadn't dried at all, so I  just combed it out and used the hair drying with a concentrator like before.  Is there a way to dry my gel'd hair within an hour or so?  I know this might be hard with my hair type.

Thank you for your time. :)",3c,  help    questions hi    everyone     i m    start    cg    journey     i d    like    ask    questions     i ve    read    faq    beginners    routine      here s

32971,7,5,2,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/9s52rs/i_think_my_hair_is_too_curly_for_cg/,"I think my hair is too curly for CGI've been trying CG for the past couple months and while it's definitely made a little difference (my hair is way less dry than it used to be), I can't help but feel like everything is more targeted for 2A-3A type hair rather than mine (3C-ish). I have tight curls and super thick hair (and so much of it. Like so much). I've been trying the basic beginner routine, trying my best to squish to condish, and leaving my hair in a plop for 15-30 mins before I leave the house, but a huge problem for me comes from the gel cast. It takes my hair about 8 hours to dry, so I can't squish out the cast until the end of the day, and then I end up going through a whole day of work looking like I have noodles on my head. Not cute. My second day hair is okay, but third day is never really that good.

I just don't know what else to do! I'm going to get a blow dryer and diffuser soon. I'd much rather avoid using heat but I don't know how else to deal with this. I'm also struggling to get nice curl clumps. I finger-detangle with a lot of conditioner but this ends up separating my curls into very small clumps since my hair gets tangled so quickly/easily. Squishing to condish has helped this a little bit but I was just looking back at some old pictures of myself and I can't help but to think that my curls had much nicer and thicker clumps back when I would just towel dry and throw some cream in there and be done with it.

My curls had a proper curl shape, around a 3a curl. We all know how long it takes to get that routine down to something that works and towards the middle of high school, I finally had it perfect. The summer before I started college I got my thyroid removed. My curls stayed for a year or so after easily, but somewhere between years two and three of college, they started getting looser and looser and looser. Now, a good four years since that surgery, I can sorta call it a wave. Sometimes if I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôll get a 2b/c type of curl out but it just depends on the water, the weather, products etc. strangely, when I travel to places I‚Äôm closer proximity to the ocean, there‚Äôs pretty defined curls, damn close to what I originally had. 

I just want them back. I miss them. I rarely use heat on my hair, not even a blow dry, and have never dyed or bleached my hair, so this has to be attributed to hormones but :(.

18968,5,0,2,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/ftm0pe/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/fmnht6i/,"Hi, everyone!

I have thick, medium porosity, mostly 2b/2c with areas of 3a hair and I've been doing a variation of the curly hair method for about two years now.

The reason why I say a variation is because in mid-late 2018 I was diagnosed with Lichen Planopilaris and was given topical steroid treatments and shots for three months while also being told to use some really harsh tea tree oil based products. For months before that, I just thought I was allergic to some ingredient and went through every product I could until I got to one that happened to be CG approved and my hair started curling which led me to the curly hair method. It wasn't until last year that I had gotten my scalp to a place where I felt comfortable experimenting with all the different steps.

Even now, though, I've really just been focused on healing the damaged hair and keeping my scalp happy, so I have a tea tree based clarifying shampoo, co-wash, leave-in conditioner, and I've recently started using Shea Moisture's hibiscus curl and style milk.

While I'm happy with the results, there's still two things I'm stuck on:

1) I'm still struggling with the top layers on the back of my head where the steroid/tea tree products were mostly applied being super dry and frizzy. What would be the best way to get these sections to catch up with the rest of my hair? Should I just keep working at it or is there something specific I should try? (I can't do anything with straight coconut oil. Tried it once and took literal days to get the damn stuff out of my hair.)

2) Gels and gel casts are something I keep reading about and I live in South Central Texas, so I'd like to find something that will lock in the moisture especially with summer coming up, but I have yet to find anything that fully dries on my hair. It doesn't seem to matter how much or how little I use, everything that isn't a leave-in conditioner leaves a...residue on my hair, mostly concentrated around where the last of the damaged hair is. And it's not like it's build-up either since it's pretty much always the first time I use the product and the only other product on my hair will be a leave-in conditioner. I've tried diffusing, plopping, air drying and every time I'm left with that weird sticky, residue feeling. I don't know if it's the damaged sections or if I'm just doing something wrong. I've tried doing the research, but can't seem to find anything. Are there any thoughts on why this keeps happening?",3a,  hi     everyone     thick     medium    porosity     mostly    2b 2c    areas    3a    hair    i ve    variation    curly    hair    method

13269,2,6,1,7,/r/curlyhair/comments/fhf08y/experience_with_shaving_and_starting_over/fkawwy5/,"Not the original commenter, but here's my 2 cents; I shaved my hair about 10 years ago to start fresh because it was royally ruined by years of heat styling, coloring and bleaching. Growing it out for me was... less than pleasant. Ive got a mixture of 2C and 3A, aka Avery big, loose curl/wave pattern. Short hair didn't really suit me because the hair would just stand in any direction and it was difficult to style. Adding to that, my hair needed constant trimming to not end up looking like a mullet (good look for some people - im not one of them.) Growing it from clean shaven to ear-lobe length took me more than a year and a half. That being said - I was a teenager, I was not yet aware of how to take care of it and style it during the growing out phase and I think the experience would be different (a little more pleasant) if I did it again today. 

If you don't mind having short hair for a long time and youre at your wits end I would say go for it! Another route to go is maybe not go buzz-cut but still chop a decent amount of?

A few years back when I first started my curly hair journey, I took the hair quiz with hope in my heart that it would help me find my holy grail products so I could have long curly locks like so many people here. I answered the questions after deep thought, rolling strands of hair between my fingers, running to the bathroom sink to see if my hair quickly absorbs water, and asked anyone that‚Äôs as in a 50 ft radius if I had ringlets or loose curls because I was going to have my glorious mane, dammit. I hit submit with sweaty palms and a racing heart waiting for my answer. The answer that will change my life and my curls. 3B!!! I felt like it was New Years in New York! I found it! I quickly hopped online, scouring all corners of the internet to find the HGs of other 3B people...my people!!! I went out and bought everything I could find in person, price tag be damned. I tried everything! Plopping, squishing, condishing, pinappleing, braiding, twisting, diffusing and air drying but I still had frizz. I didn‚Äôt know what it was. But I kept trying because I was going to get those ringlets. 

Until last night....

I got a wild hair up my ass, retook the quiz absentmindedly and landed on a new hair type. 2A. I was crushed, mortified and heartbroken. My wallet was even screaming in my purse, ‚ÄúYOU USED ME FOR THE WRONG THING.‚Äù We sobbed together. I looked at pictures of 2A and realized I don‚Äôt have coils, I have S-curls. How could I be so blind?? I feel like I‚Äôve lost a part of me, found something new about me but my whole identity is wrong. But it‚Äôs totally okay because now I know what I need to do to take care of my curls, wait I mean my waves.

33014,5,7,2,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/9wlr5c/new_to_cgm_any_advice_for_products_getting/,"New to CGM, any advice for products, getting started, routines, etc.Hi all. I‚Äôm over 30 and recently discovered the curly girl method. I have somewhere between 3a-3b hair. It‚Äôs very fine, and INCREDIBLY frizzy. Like seriously, I have a lions mane. 

I‚Äôm aware the frizz comes from years of dying, straightening, and overall bad choices in products I‚Äôve been using. I‚Äôm trying to embrace the curls and get on the path to healthy hair. 

I ‚Äúofficially‚Äù started the CGM last night. I spent the last week or so looking at reviews of products, YouTube videos, and finding products I think I want to try for my curls. I did my final sulfate wash last night, followed by a cleanse and condition. I put my leave in, and gel in while my hair was still sopping wet, and used a towel to plop. Because it was late at night I slept with my plop.

I‚Äôll be honest. I don‚Äôt love my curls today. They‚Äôre soft, but look kind of funny. I think part of it is my hair cut. I have smaller layers for straight hair, and while I don‚Äôt have that classics triangle shape, it doesn‚Äôt look good. I know it takes time, but I guess I was super excited because a lot of people talk about how awesome their curls look even on day 1, and then that didn‚Äôt happen for me.

So here I am. Reaching out to the curly community. What are things you do? What are products you love? I want to dry devacurl, but I‚Äôm also looking for good products that are a little more reasonably priced. 

I‚Äôd love any advice you want to give. This ended up being much longer than planned.

30097,5,7,2,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/a502xm/ive_been_using_devacurl_shampoo_conditioner_for_a/,"I've been using DevaCurl shampoo &amp; conditioner for a month now, and recently started using the styling cream. I'm now less happy with my curls than I was to begin with.Hey, everyone! So, as the title suggests, I've been using DevaCurl products for just over a month now. While my hair smells great and some of the curls turn out beautiful, I keep noticing that every single time I wash my hair there are massive portions of hair that are just... not curly. They're frizzy and barely wavy, and show up mostly on the back of my head, rather than towards the front. Even just washed and dried I end up looking like I slept (restlessly, I might add) directly on it. This is extremely weird for me considering my natural curl texture is a mix between 2c/3a.

I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. I use a microfiber towel (I scrunch the towel, rather than haphazardly roughing up my hair until it's dry, like tons of non-curly people do), I take the time to apply the cream to each individual strand, and  recently I've been partially drying the roots with a diffuser attachment (with my head hanging upside down, mind you) to help with volume (which is a whole other issue for me... for some reason my hair WILL NOT retain any kind of volume). I condition every time I wash my hair (every other day) and shampoo my hair once, maybe twice, a week.   


What gives? Have any of you experienced something similar to this? It's seriously draining my confidence because my curls are such a huge part of my appearance and happiness. If y'all have any suggestions, tips, products, or advice you could give, I would appreciate it all SO much.

Which is - based on the last few pics - 2b with some 2c.

For the denman brush, if you want to use it - and I would say you don't need it, you have great, uniform definition in the last few pics - watch some youtube tutorials, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KblOiRRgGjE&amp;t=1s).",2b,  wow    hair    looks    amazing     sure    advice    looking    apart    curl    type               based    last    pics         2b    2c     important    curl    type    porosity     i    would    say    normal     since    hair    processed     low         long    take    air    dry    hair       denman    brush     want    use         would    say    need    it     great     uniform    definition    last    pics         watch    youtube    tutorials     like     this    one  https   www youtube com watch v kbloirrggje amp t 1s    ,wow hair look amazing sure advice looking apart curl type based last pic 2b 2c important curl type porosity i would say normal since hair processed low long take air dry hair denman brush want use would say need it great uniform definition last pic watch youtube tutorial like this one http www youtube com watch v kbloirrggje amp t 1,wow hair look amazing sure advice looking apart curl type based last pic 2b 2c important curl type porosity would say normal since hair processed low long take air dry hair denman brush want use would say need great uniform definition last pic watch youtube tutorial like one http www youtube com watch v kbloirrggje amp 1,Moisture/Masks,Cutting/Growing,Drying Routines,Advice for Textured Hair

\*\*Is it CG friendly? (copy/paste answer from IsItCG):\*\* So, IsitCG is saying no because it's categorizing SODIUM LAURYL SULFOACETATE as a sulfate, and that's just not correct. SLSA is a surfactant, but it's not a sulfate or at all related to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (which is a sulfate). I've submitted a review of SLSA to the website owners but haven't heard back. 

\*\*Is it cruelty free? (yes/no/unknown):\*\* yes

\*\*Price range:\*\*  $$-$$$ (depends if you sign up for it on Amazon)

\*\*Ingredient list:\*\* SAPINDUS MUKOROSSI (Wild Soapberry) JUICE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE (from Coconut), HYDROLYZED JOJOBA ESTERS (from Jojoba Oil), SODIUM LAUROYL SARCOSINATE (from Coconut), SODIUM LAURYL SULFOACETATE (from Coconut), CAPRYLYL GLYCOL (from Coconut) &amp; DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL &amp; GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE (from Coconut), DECYL GLUCOSIDE (from Coconut), LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA (Lavender) ESSENTIAL OIL, TETRASODIUM GLUTAMATE DIACETATE, POLYQUATERNIUM-67, CITRIC ACID (from Corn), MATRICARIA CHAMOMILLA (Organic Chamomile) EXTRACT, OLEA EUROPAEA (Organic Olive) LEAF EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF (Organic Aloe Vera) JUICE, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL (Organic Argan Oil) 

\*\*Other info:\*\*  It's ph 5.5 (neutral) and gets most of its saponification from the Soapberry nut. It's an unusual and very cool product. 

\*\*Your hair info (optional) (e.g. porosity, thickness, density):\*\*  regular porosity, pretty thick and dense. I have 3a(?) curls. 

\*\*Experience &amp; opinion:\*\* I absolutely love this stuff; it smells great and works beautifully. I didn't even realize that I had curly hair until I started using it-- that's how CG-wonderful it is :D . I was so happy that I could keep it in my CGM 'cause I'd be pretty bummed out otherwise.

I really don't see why that would affect anything because I still use a suphate shampoo which gets rid of the oil. I get lots of buildup and live in a really polluted area where by the end of the week, my hair resembles a rat's nest with dust and grime so I HAVE to clarify. Another thing I've noticed is that my hair has gotten unusually soft to the point that it disintegrates into a frizzy mess after drying. 

I don't know if I'd call my routine completely CG because of the shampoo but I have been at this for about 4 months now.

13788,5,3,7,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/ga4yop/fighting_hard_water_during_the_quarantine_and/foy2ony/,"Hard water is such a struggle, I am right there with you. I actually grew up thinking I had 'frizzy straight hair' until I moved to a place without hard water for several years, and bam, waves and curls! I'm back in my hard-water home now and like you, I've tried so many things. It sounds like you're doing everything right but I'll add some of my own tips that have helped revive my curls despite hard water!

Firstly, I try to use products with no heavy natural emollients (shea butter and coconut oil are my main two issues). Whenever I switch to products with them, my hair feels so heavy and coated. I think it can't handle the mineral depositing of the hard water plus the natural emollients coating my hair. I find when I use conditioners and leave-ins without these kinds of ingredients my hair bounces right back. I do find where I live coconut oil is in basically every product, so I will also try to ensure only one product in my wash has it so it's not as weighing.

Second, I actually 'reset' my hair every month or so with a sulfate shampoo. I have 2c/3a hair and by the end of the month all the 3a looks like 2c. After I reset, deep condition, then wash, it goes back to 3a mostly. The sulfates not only get rid of the emollients, but the hard water mineral buildup. Maybe not entirely approved on this sub, but it does help me a lot!

Thirdly, I wash out my conditioner with a water filter and apply my leave-in using filtered water. Sometimes if I have the time and energy I will also wash out my shampoo with filtered water and do the bowl method for my leave-in. It is SO long, but we have a intense drinking water filter in my house that I find it way better than the hard water shower filter, so I will fill up some jugs with that, turn off the shower, and go that route. It has made a noticeable difference in preserving my curls to day 2 and 3!

I would say out of these things the first one is what made the most difference, but all of them together have had relative success. My hair is by no means as 'nice' as it was when I lived in a soft water area, but it has bounce and does not feel greasy anymore! There's a bunch of other things I do, but these three are where I notice change. Good luck to you, the hard water life is truly awful sometimes but I'm sure you will find a way to revive your curls amidst it!",2c,  hard    water    struggle     right    you     actually    grew

Most older women at work (40 and up) tell me they **love** my straight hair. I know they dislike the curly thing I‚Äôve got going on. Young women and men of all ages always like it. I genuinely think it‚Äôs just the association with curly hair being less refined or more fun, which leads people to think that it means less professional, or rather, less proper.

At the end of the day, people who relentlessly judge deep characteristics on superficial details are insecure. To me, it comes off as a little sad and also jealous. 

If someone made a statement to me/around me like your friend did, I would call them out by asking how they rated my professionalism. And then I‚Äôd probe to see how far the ignorance went: are black women less professional because of their natural hair? Are curly haired men less professional? What about bald men? What about a woman with cancer who wears a curly wig? What makes it less professional? If it‚Äôs too ‚Äúmessy‚Äù, are curly haired park rangers okay? What about professional farmers?

9327,6,7,0,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/9o7bs3/decided_to_experiment_with_third_day_hair_3b/e7ry9av/,"I started the CG method back in July, and I'm still trying to find what works and what doesn't and still hunting for my ""holy grail"" products. I have **3b** hair mostly, with some 2c and 3a pieces underneath and around the sides of my face. My main issues with my hair are frizz, definition, shrinkage, and volume so I keep trying a different mix of products/routine because I'm not 100% satisfied with my hair yet (is anyone?? lol).

**Today's routine:**

I was working with third day hair, so I just re-wet it until it was dripping and pretty saturated. Then I sectioned my hair down the middle and combed out both sections with a wide-tooth comb.

I first went in with my conditioner, **Suave Essentials Ocean Breeze**, using the praying hands method which I've never done before. Then I scrunched a lot. My hair was making that squelchy/squishy sound, fyi - that's the amount of water it had in it.

Next, I used the **Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie**, not too much because it's too heavy and thick for my hair. It makes my hair feel greasy and weighed down if I use too much.

Then I used the **Shea Moisture Superfruit Multi-Vitamin Soft Curl Gel-Cream** (my hair LOVES gel creams) using the same method as above: praying hands then lots of squishing/scrunching.

Finally, I finished with **LA Looks Mega Shaper** gel (the yellow one) - a decent-sized dollop. More praying, more scrunching. Then I carefully scrunched out any excess moisture with a t-shirt. I wanted to see how long my hair takes to air dry *without touching it at all*...5 hours total. I usually don't have the patience to wait to scrunch out the crunch but today I waited until it was about 90-95% dry before scrunching. And it was worth it!! I haven't had a hair day this good in I don't even know when. It's sooo soft and clumped up really well, and there's not a lot of frizz. [These are my results](https://imgur.com/a/rmCJRKS)!

**Here's my issue:** I don't want to wait for my hair to dry for 5 hours before it looks presentable. Is there a way I can speed up the process without sacrificing the end result too much? My hair does well diffused, so maybe I could try air drying for a little while and then diffusing?

Also, using the routine above, I got next to ***no volume,*** as you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/2W8GjfE). I fluffed my fingers through the roots a lot which helped, but is there anything else I should be doing to get more volume?",2c,  started    cg    method    back    july     i m    still    trying

32285,2,0,7,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/g54r10/curl_training_while_conditioning/,"Curl Training while ConditioningI was wondering if there‚Äôs any truth to training curls while deep conditioning hair. Does twisting curls while deep conditioning really impact how hair curls? Or is it a figment of my imagination?

So basically:

- My curls (2c/3a high porosity) have been very damaged and practically straightened by a bleach job gone bad a few months back, which I then had to dye over to fix and caused more damage. I used to be CG but then found out about DevaCurl in February. I live in a country without many curly hair products so have been using the non-CG products until I can order others from abroad when COVID restrictions are over. 

- I have recently been doing rice rinses I saw a random Instagram post that showed someone twisting her hair in mini-braids with deep conditioner in her hair. So, the other day, with rice water and deep conditioner in my hair, I did tight mini braids all over my hair and left it for 20 minutes.

- I then washed it out. Squished to condish with regular conditioner. Added Adeva Damage Remedy Leave-In and combed through. Glazed over Aussie Curl Defining Oil then scrunched in Moroccon Oil Curl Defining cream. Dry plopped for 30 minutes and air-dried.

- I noticed my hair had tight curls with actual twists into one another as if emulating the shape of the mini-braids!!! So does that mean that the curl training while deep conditioning actually worked? Even though it was brushed out later?

Perhaps wave maker would give you better results, or one of the lighter gels. I have 2c/3a/3b hair and if I use styling cream and arc angel my hair is super weighed down. I stick with the ultra defining gel and a shea moisture curl smoothie and get good results.

&gt;Someone created a curl identification system to determine the ""type"" of one's curl. We recommend not worrying about what ""type"" you are because:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) It doesn't help you decide what products or techniques to use  
&gt;  
&gt;2) Your hair will almost definitely change as you take better care of it. [See this example of one person's hair. The left image is fluffy, maybe a bit of texture, curl type 1A if that, right? But the next picture is only a few months later, following CG techniques and using only CG-approved products. Suddenly 2b, 2c with one or two 3a and 2a sprinkled in!](https://imgur.com/ozDZBsS)

*Processing img sosgl2p8f5741...*

Hello! I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep a long story short but I‚Äôm about 3 months into CG and not loving the results (more so because of the cut and some pesky bangs) but I‚Äôm confident this just needs more time. 

I guess you could say I‚Äôm ‚Äòtransitioning‚Äò still as my roots are FAR curlier than my ends are. The image is a few days after wash so it‚Äôs a lot more settled and stretched out than on wash day. I‚Äôd say roots and underside (the most virgin areas of my head) are a 2c-3a while the ends fall more into 2b-2c, and sometimes even a flat 2a. 

I recently tried a protein treatment for the first time which my hair LOVED, it made the waves at the ends so much more shiny and defined, and way less frizz. But it also made my root curl pattern much stronger... ultimately highlighting the difference in curl patterns throughout my hair. 

At this point I‚Äôm really trying to minimise the look of curly roots and straight ends and have been almost stretching and laying my roots as flat as possible, tucking it behind my ears, etc., while still scrunching the ends to even out the texture but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding the right balance!

Would it make any sense to treat the roots differently to the ends by maybe adding moisture up top and protein at the bottom? 

Does anyone have any tips for the transition period that aren‚Äôt about ways to tie it back? I‚Äôd really like to avoid all of the progress in curl memory ‚Äòtraining‚Äô by pulling it into buns and braids that could disrupt that... 

Lastly, I don‚Äôt mind stretched out waves/curls at all (I even prefer day 2 hair most times after it‚Äôs settled down) and my goal isn‚Äôt volume up top so I‚Äôm happy to sacrifice definition and/or volume for just a more uniform, tame look! 

**ROUTINE**

I switch it up constantly as I get a little desperate for something to work but am currently home for holidays so it has forced me to stick to these few products and really test properly... 

1. **Burts Bees More Moisture Shampoo** Don‚Äôt have anything to say about this really. As a wavy my hair really doesn‚Äôt mind a light shampoo. I use a scalp massager to work it in and then fully rinse. I have As I Am Coconut Cowash waiting for me for when I finish up this bottle though. 
2. **Noughty Intensive Care Conditioner** STC. Again just kind of using this up as I neither like nor dislike it. Have tried both upside down and right side up but really can‚Äôt decide what works better. Hair is only shoulder length so it doesn‚Äôt fall back down nicely once I flip upright and the roots go absolutely wild. Equally, it lays a little too flat against my head if I do it all right side up. Have been experimenting more recently with tipping my head side to side and doing it parallel to the ground. This is working okay... 
3. **Pantene No. 5 Mousse** I THINK I really like this but again, I can never tell what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. I keep using it though so I think instinctively it works for me? I focus this on the ends. 
4. **Aussie Instant Freeze Gel** This is also good I think, I was using another that didn‚Äôt have protein in it and tons of glycerin but after the protein revelation I switched to this. 
5. Microfibre microplop to get excess moisture/product out
6. Manipulate fringe/ roots that have gone a little too crazy
7. Air-dry \~70% (or as long as I can wait as it takes easily 5 hours to get to this point) and then sometimes diffuse the rest of the way. SOTC. 

**TL;DR**

Roots are way too curly compared to the rest of my hair and I‚Äôd like to minimise cowlicks and volume up top, and get the texture to behave while I grow it out.",3a,  moisture    vs     protein

I‚Äôve been working towards finding my routine in CGM and still playing with products, but I realized that I have low porosity very recently and I want to see what will happen if I were to really cater to that.

My current routine is co-wash with Not Your Mother‚Äôs Coconut Milk &amp; African Marula Tree Oil conditioner every two days, one day on, one day off (I can‚Äôt seem to make it to the 3rd day yet), once every 8-9 days I use Kinky Curly Come Clean for shampoo, and once a week I use DevaCurl Heaven in Hair Deep Conditioner. Once out of the shower, I use Giovanni direct Leave-In, and Jessicurl Spiralicious Gel (sometimes I instead substitute for Kinky Curly Curling Custard as my gel) on very wet hair, then scrunch out excess water with a Hair RePear towel. Airdry, always, and The Body Shop‚Äôs Grapeseed Oil to scrunch the crunch out with some shine and help soften the hair.

I‚Äôve been feeling that while my hair has steadily been making progress, I can‚Äôt make it to the third day because despite a satin scarf wrap and satin pillowcase, my hair still consistently knots itself over night, hates my ouidad refresher spray, as it gets really stiff like I sprayed hairspray on it and does not really bend to my will after using, (waiting for Witch I love your hair magic mist to come in for trial test), so I get one day after shower out of it at best. I‚Äôm wondering if perhaps these products aren‚Äôt best for my hair and contribute to this.

Originally I thought I was over moisturized, so I invested in protein treatment (Shea Moisture Manuka Honey). While that improved things a bit, I keep running into the same problem. When I apply my gel, my hair goes into very small (I mean VERY small) clumps, despite being all the same wave pattern, and my hair looks stringy and limp as a result.  Frizz has also been a big issue. Is it the gel I'm using or something else? Routine and hair type listed below.  


I'm 2 months in, I use function of beauty (I believe my formulation is CG friendly, it can be hard to find the full ingredients, but it restored my waves), shea moisture manuka leave in and shea moisture coconut holding gel. I did the shea moisture black soap clarifying mask as well before beginning.  Microfiber towels, styling, and then air dry. Protein treatment above once a week (I was told this was a good frequency for color treated hair).  


My hair is 2b, some parts are more 2a, and before going CG I highlighted it so it's slightly bleached. High density and porosity, medium thickness.

36589,5,0,2,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/dlyyy6/why_is_my_curl_journey_lasting_like_2_years_this/,Why is my curl journey lasting like 2 years?!?! this is long but pls take the time to read i need advice!So my hair has gradually been getting curly for a few years. In around late 2016 it started getting puffy and dry (I previously had pretty smooth 1c hair once the frizz died down after brushing it). So it started getting puffier and dryer then in 2017 i woke up one day after washing it and had curls/waves. I would pin it at 2a/2b and this is when i stopped brushing it to reduce frizz. It never went past sort of wavy but i always had these little ringlets at the front and when i pulled bits out of my ponytail and wet them i would get cute ringlets as well. I realised that it was genuinely curly in summer 2018 when I chopped off about 10 inches to donate and then went to Costa Rica and in the climate i would say i had 3b curls. Then i came back to uk and it gradually went puffy and around 2a. Then in summer again now in 2019 i changed my shampoo to reduce build up and chose one without things like sulphates and silicones etc. I also had been using a curling cream which hadn‚Äôt curled my hair much but kept it moisturised (actually it made my hair curl more in soft water but we have hard water at home). So i got a new cream as well and it started getting gradually curlier. I then stopped straightening it (i only did this now and then mind you) and tried to commit to the ‚Äòcurly girl method‚Äô to get my curls back. It was working sort of but veeery slowly.  Then in july i went to visit some family in Brazil and thought maybe the climate would bring back my curls and whilst they were more defined than they are here. They were still onlt maybe 2c if i was lucky and 3a near the ends. It has continued on like this and I changed my hair products as well to vegan ones and the only cream that curls my hair I find it too oily and a bit drying tbh (its the maui curly shampoo conditioner and cream and I previously used cantu). I can‚Äôt afford the likes of devacurl. Someone pls help me I‚Äôm at a loss how do i get my lovely 3c hair back and whats a decent product that an average teenager can afford!

Wash with aveeno pure renewal shampoo and conditioner. Flip head over and scrunch hair. Add LA gel and scrunch more. Plop for 20-30 minutes and then diffuse. 

The picture in the green shirt is my hair on a good day. The two other pictures are my hair wet. I wish my hair would dry like it is when it‚Äôs wet but it always starts to fall. Any suggestions on how to make my waves more defined and last longer?

Additionally, if I comb my hair out, it struggles to create waves like I want it to. But if I don‚Äôt comb it, it gets matted on the top (I‚Äôm guessing from where I shampooed it). So any help here? 

Also, should I be using a leave in conditioner? I feel like it might weigh my hair down but I‚Äôm definitely open to try it.

I'd say my hair is 2a/2b and it is quite long. I also believe it is low porosity since it takes sooooo long to dry. 

*My current routine*:

* Sulfate and silicone free shampoo for dry scalp (can't remember the name right now)

* Tresemme Botanique Coconut conditioner (S2C)

* L'Oreal Studio Line Invisihold Gel (The *Is It CG?* ingredient checker only pointed out one ingredient to be wary of)

* Plop with a microfiber turbie twist style towel (backwards so my hair isn't caught in the twist)

* Put my hair in a ponytail or braid it to sleep (still experimenting with what looks best)

**Concerns**: lack of definition, frizz, weirdness in the back crown area

Edit: Forgot to mention I get these weird twisty, chunky strands of hair in the back of my head that are like trying to be curls but end up just looking a bit dreadlock-y? I'm not sure if that's just my hair trying to curl

36467,3,6,5,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/cwmood/my_devacurl_experience/,"My DevaCurl ExperienceHey everyone!   
I'm mixed race with 3A/3B hair. I've been wearing my hair curly for almost 10 years and have worn it exclusively curly for almost 2 (haven't had it straight or had a blow out since November 2017). 

For a long time, I was a user and supporter of DevaCurl products. I thought they were the holy grail, as so many curly girls swore by them. They also had a high price point which I thought meant the quality of their products was better, and I loved the variety of products for me to experiment with.

Everything with my hair was fine until late last year. I ordered more Deva products to replace my empty bottles and I started noticing a lot of shedding. Eventually, my ends also became really dry and brittle and I was getting tangles that were just outrageous. My curls were losing shape. Recently, a rash/patches of dry and itchy skin started to appear on my neck, in the areas where my hair was touching. I noticed thinning at my temples. I was in hell. 

I thought it was me. Every shower was a new time to experiment. I tried different product combos, different styling techniques, different diffusers, air drying vs diffusing..you name it, I tried it. To no avail. I was still losing heaps of hair and my curls were falling flat. I had medical testing cause I thought it was an issue with my health, but everything came up fine. 

About a month ago, I saw a post on IG from the Curl Ninja about Deva products. I was shocked as I knew she always recommended them. I watched her video and then started seeing dozens of comments from other consumers, all of them detailing the same things I had experienced. 

I IMMEDIATELY switched off Deva curl and my hair saw an instant change after *my first shower* with new products. Within a week, the rash on my neck faded and disappeared. My ends are no longer dry, and my curls are starting to form coils again. 

I am 100% convinced DevaCurl is to blame for this. If ANYONE else is having these issues, you're not alone. 

I have switched to the AG Natural Balance Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (they were kind enough to send me free samples when I reached out to them), as well as their Foam, Re: Coil and the Mousse Gel. 

If you're using Deva and are having similar issues, STOP using it! I also reached out to them via email and requested a full refund. They have since sent me a shipping label and I am sending everything I have of theirs back to them.

11011,7,3,1,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/bsqpe3/hair_type_and_routine_help/eoujpmj/,"Wow your hair is just like mine, even the color is almost the same!! The picture from the back could be me!!! Your curl pattern is more 2c with some 3a spiral curls in it.

I only started the CGM less than a month ago and have already some minor visible results - not much, but good enough to keep me going. 

Start the CGM but **do not get overwhelmed**! Keep it as simple as possible. It will help your hair tremendously, I promise!

Buy a sulfate free shampoo, a silicone-free conditioner, an alcohol-free gel and some curl milk to use as leave-in. Throw out all of the products that contain sulfates, silicones, alcohols. By throw out I mean give to your friends or someone in need. 

Wash your hair one last time with a sulfate shampoo, then only use it once a month for clarifying. 

Since your hair seems just like mine, I will tell you the routine that works for me in detail - sorry if it is too much detail, but I'd rather explain than have you confused :)

I wash my hair separately, never at the same time as showering, because I do it by leaning forward into the tub so my head is upside down, so please keep this in mind when reading the below.

Use a lot of conditioner, but do not apply it on your scalp, only the bottom 2/3rd. Smooth it over the top and bottom layer, press it in with your hands. Let it sit for a while, if your hair is knotted and tangled, this is the time to detangle, either using your hands only, or a denman brush/wetbrush/tangle teaser, but only hands is fine too. 

Rinse the conditioner all the way out - I know some people don't, but with fine hair, it will weigh the hair down if you leave some in. Use cold water.

With hair dripping wet, detangle once again - I use the wetbrush because it helps the clumps form. 

Squeeze out almost all excess water with your hands by putting them beneath the hair ends (my head is upside down) and scrunching the hair upwards like an accordion. Do it with all of your hair in sections. 

Take the curl cream/leave-in (I use Maui Moisture Curl Milk, the orange one), put a smallish dollop in your hands, distribute in your palms and start smoothing it in your hair with both hands (one outside, one inside) in sections, so sides first, then the front, then the back (lift the top section). Do not use too much, because it will weigh down your hair. Once it is in, scrunch it in, 2-3 scrunches per section, you do not need to be precise at this point.

Then take a big dollop of gel - more than you think you should use - and do the same as with the curl milk.

By the time you are finished applying the gel, your hair will be dripping wet again, use this to your advantage to distribute the products evenly and scrunch some more, this time more precisely than after the curl milk. 

Take the t-shirt or microfiber towel, put it down on a flat surface, lean into it, do it like this: [https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/to-plop-or-not-to-plop](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/to-plop-or-not-to-plop)

Leave in for 15-20 minutes, then you are ready for diffusing (another novel :)) or air drying, whichever works for you. 

Okay my fingers are getting tired so I will stop here, let me know if you need more info regarding anything, and also I recommend you watch Curly Susie on youtube, she is from Canada as well so I think she can show you products you can use and she has videos about the CGM routine which were very useful to me. 

And just for reference, here is my hair when I started the CGM a month ago, vs. yesterday - small progress but already visible!

20327,7,2,4,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/a7xr7h/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_dec_20_2018/ecbaquk/,"Hello, So I kinda just figured out what S2C is, so I am more confident in my curls. My sides still be frizzy, so I need maybe protein or a deep conditioner, not sure witch. If anyone has recommendations for not too expensive ones, that would be nice. Routine is simple (condition, rinse, condition, brush with a slightly stiffer wet brush, S2C, prayer hands gel or moose, dry with whatever shirt I find (usually 60% cotton), and then sleep on satin and see what happens in morning)

Also more importantly my hair is too long. I am a guy and I have let my hair grow for at least 9 months and while the curls are pretty they are too long and are taking over. I want a style that still shows off my curls, but isn't too much. I don't want people to stop me and ask if my hair is real or to call it ""fun"". I want people to say oh wow your hair looks nice. I have 3b/3c hair and I think a triangle face shape.

Images of my hair right now: https://imgur.com/a/sNRQIP7
Images of my hair 2-3 months ago being slightly shorter: https://imgur.com/a/TsNwLd1
When it is really short it is more wavy than curly. Like less than 1.5-2 inches. Which is weird because it grows out and the ends become curly even though they were once wavier.

So I have spent like 3+ hours looking at hair styles and am still so lost. I think something like a curly quiff could work, but It's hard to find people with the same 3c/3b with the style.

23201,4,0,5,7,/r/curlyhair/comments/c83fhl/ive_fallen_off_the_bandwagon_twice_because_i_got/esjt667/,"My hair wasn't nearly as bad off as I initially thought it was. I thought I needed to co-wash and use heavier products because my hair was a dried out puff. It wasn't dyed or heat damaged, I didn't own a brush before starting CG, I just didn't understand what kind of moisture and treatment my hair needed. I went from a kinda wavy tumbleweed to 2c-3c curls.

I can't rely on co-washing only to give me decent looking hair. My hair is fine to medium width, medium high density. I need to use low-poo. I like the Giovanni Smooth as Silk. It helps keep buildup (mostly product, my scalp doesn't get greasy) at bay, meaning I only need to clarify 1-2x/month, and that's mostly to get rid of hard water build up. It hasn't been drying, and I wash daily or every other day in the summer, less often in the winter. It has ingredients that can supposedly break down silicone ingredients. I don't use them personally, but if you do, it might be an option for incorporating a low-poo into your routine. I like to do an oil pre-poo twice a week before shampooing. Especially if I'm going to clarify. If you can't use oils, or don't have any, you can try using conditioner. I was getting fairy knots on my ends and the oil pre-poos have gotten rid of those completely.

I didn't like the Tresemme conditioner as a co-wash, conditioner or leave-in. It seemed heavy without actually moisturizing. My hair likes lighter condition with lighter or no oils. The only time I actively use oils is to pre-poo or oil rinse. Anything else is too much for my hair. I had better luck with VO5 Extra Body and their Kiwi Lime. The bottles are BOGO often at Walgreen's and CVS, so you can get a lot of conditioner for a couple of bucks. I don't feel bad really globbing it on. Giovanni makes some really nice conditioners and leave-ins, some are CG, some are not. NYM has lighter products without oils as well. I haven't tried them, but have heard good things.

Never had good luck with Garnier either. Sometimes, in the summer, I don't even need a leave-in and might go right to gel or mousse. I like the Giovanni Direct Leave-in and their Vitapro fusion. The spray I like in the summer when I need lighter weight products. I can co-wash with the Direct Leave-in once in a while if I need to. I can add both of these to my hair to refresh without worry of much buildup. They're very light. My hair needs moisture daily. If I need to wet my hands and add more, my hair tends to be better off for it. The As I Am original leave-in is oil-free and light weight. It's not as light as the Giovanni. Eden Bodyworks Coconut Shea leave-in is light enough to add to my hair daily without building up and has good slip. NYM is another oil-free conditioner option.

Avoiding glycerin or at least keeping it lower down the ingredient list in any product I leave in my hair helped a lot to avoid frizz and loss of shape from too much moisture. I didn't know my hair could have too much moisture. It sure can! Protein helps, especially finer, damaged or colored/chemically processed hair or finer to medium width hair in humid conditions. My hair likes hydrolyzed collagen a lot. I think that's part of the reason it likes the VO5 conditioners and the DIY gelatin treatment. I only need the DIY treatment in the summer. And not nearly as often as I did, say last year when I was still using products that were too much for my hair.

Deep conditioning once a week. Not Your Mother Naturals has some oil-free, lighter oil options. Shea Moisture also has some good options if your hair can stand a heavier deep conditioning.

I have to diffuse my hair. My hair is low porosity and seems to work better with a little heat. Otherwise, my hair will take 18+ hours to air dry with just a light leave-in, much less gel or any styling products. If I air dry, my hair frizzes and loses shape long before it ever fully dries out. If I diffuse on medium heat, it helps encourage my curl pattern and locks everything in. I don't even need a styler that often anymore. Just use some leave-in conditioner on hair that I partially dry by scrunching in a soft t-shirt and go right to diffusing. I also saw that someone mentioned getting some water out of your hair and adding your gel or other styler. I second this method. My hair looks better and I don't need to use the heaping handfuls of gel a lot of people have to use.

Once I figured out what my hair wanted, it sprang up pretty fast. It was more finding the products and techniques that worked for my hair. I'm a nurse, so my hair is up all the time. Difference between now and before is that I'm a lot more conscious of what I'm doing. I don't do tight styles, I don't just tear an elastic hair tie out like I used to, I use scrunchies or those elasticized cloth head bands to tie my hair up and I don't run my fingers through my hair, I kind gather all my hair together by smoothing it rather than raking through it.

Sorry, that was a lot.

I'll be the controversial one here and say that I honestly believe your hair looks nice and healthy as-is; trying a full blown CG routine with 8 steps like some on here with a very loose wave will likely just make it limp, greasy, and weighed down. However, there is nothing wrong with swapping your current products for CG friendly ones, so long as you are mindful of what is in them so as to not weigh down your hair.

But then I washed my hair and it is a disaster. The ends are totally uneven - it looks like someone hacked my hair at the ends.  I have several random strands that are sticking out from below because that strand did not curl as much as it had on appointment day. My curls dry differently depending on weather (2c-3b), and to be honest, my hair's temperament, and as a result, the curly hair cut, which is based on how your curls look on appointment day, did not look good at all.  Especially since I shortened my hair considerably, which again changed the type of curling. My stylist was awesome and I genuinely don't think it was her fault. She could only work with what she saw on that day.

If you're wondering why I add so many products like the Noughty Creme, I watch a lot of videos of various curly hair methods from wavy and curly hair Youtubers who say that it's a good idea to add a frizz-free product in.

Sorry, I haven‚Äôt read the wiki first!
I would like some product recommendations, specifically concerning gel. I have been doing the curly girl method for a few months. I have wavy hair, 2b to 2c when freshly washed. I currently use curly girl friendly shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner. I use DevaCurl b‚Äôleave in and I have only tried two gels. The one I got first is the LA Looks max Spikes level 12 hold gel. I have tried the JessiCurl Spiralicious Styling Gel, but I find that when I use this gel, on hair day two, my waves fall down to around a 2a. This does not happen with LA Looks gel. And I always clip up my hair ‚ÄúMedusa‚Äù style to preserve the ways while I sleep. I always apply my gel in the shower with wet hair and plop. Then I do double application of the gel. Still, with that gel I just find that it doesn‚Äôt hold my waves very well. I‚Äôm wondering if I doing something wrong? My go to answer is to find gels with lots of hold. 

I want to try other gels, especially because LA Looks contains parabens. Any gel or any other product recommendations? Or any tips that could be helpful?

37344,4,7,2,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/93uv9e/trying_to_regain_my_tight_curls/,"Trying to regain my tight curlsUntil a couple years ago, I always had short hair (under 6 inches) that generally curled up into a tight 3c or so, just from conditioning and air-drying. Two years ago I started growing it out, and as it's gotten longer the curls have gotten a lot looser, possibly just because of the added weight. I still like my hair, but sometimes I miss those tight curls I used to have!

I've tried about 30 different products in the last two years, since this was all brand-new to me! My current routine is:
- Devacurl One No-poo 
- V05 Moisture Milk conditioner (soaking wet hair)
- rinse that out, scrunch in a little Kinky-Curly Knot Today to wet-not-soaking hair
- scrunch in either Devacurl Ultra Defining Gel or Kinky-Curly Curling Custard
- From there, I've been rotating different ways to dry it (plopping, air-dry up, air-dry down, diffuse up, diffuse down, and so on).
- Once every couple weeks, I do a deep condition with Shea Moisture 10-in-1.

Does anyone have a great routine/product for restoring the tighter curls of their shorter-hair days, or recommendations for something I should add? I've been looking at things like protein treatments and Buildup Buster, but it's hard to tell if those would help or not.

6914,1,6,7,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/e6gxyc/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/f9y1756/,"To be honest I think what you‚Äôre asking is more to do with the thickness and porosity of your hair than how curly it is. 

But I have wavy (2b) high porosity hair and after a lot of experimenting I‚Äôve found that get best results if I apply gel after I plop. If I do it beforehand my hair seems to just absorb all the gel, I‚Äôve always assumed it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs high porosity.

Another thing is that, while I do use shampoo/conditioner that probably isn't great for me(it's basically just left over of what my mom uses as I like the smell better than the Axe that she gets her kids), I generally don't have much issues other than two that have come up recently. One is that my hair isn't getting any longer, and two is that when I pick my hair out before I shower(to allow me to easily get my hands through and wash thoroughly), a LOT of hair comes out.

I come out my hair upside down with a wide tooth comb while there‚Äôs conditioner in it. That lets the waves break up and clump. I squish to condish, then I use a microfiber towel to dry my hair, still upside down.

I squeeze in some kind of gel. Right now I‚Äôm using it‚Äôs a 10. Then I pin one side of my front up a little to get it out of my face (growing out bangs).

My hair has now been reduced to waves with some straight hairs, ridding me of the curls I once had. 

Here is my routine, if needed: I apply Selsun Blue first to help with my dandruff issue, then I apply Syoss Curls &amp; Waves shampoo, wash it out, then I apply the conditioner of the same brand, detangle my hair, then I wash it out last. I squeeze out all the water from my hair. Afterwards I let my hair air dry and then apply the Syoss Curls &amp; Waves texture balm to keep my hair decent. I do this at least two times every week.

My hair is roughly shoulder-length (when pulled straight) and it grows fairly quickly, but it seems like I experience a lot of breakage. When I pull my hair back into a ponytail, there are always a lot of strands that aren't long enough to make it into the ponytail and they just wave around my face. Sometimes the hairs are only two or three inches long!! Has anyone experienced this? How do you fix it??

&amp;#x200B;

Routine:

I wash my hair once a week and co-wash about once a week.

When I wash it, I also deep condition (not with heat, I just leave it on for \~10min in the shower) and comb detangle. I use a regular conditioner when I co-wash and usually do a comb detangle then as well.

After washing or cowashing, I'll use a microfibre towel to towel dry, then use a leave-in conditioner + almond or argan oil + usually kinky curly gel.

On days when I don't wash or cowash, I'll usually spritz my hair with water and oil it. 

I use a silk scarf to sleep -- usually I'll wrap it around my hair but sometimes when I'm lazy I'll just lay it down on my pillow and sleep on top of it.

4. Plop for 20 min
5. Air dry, no touching. The scrunch out the crunch. However, no matter how much gel I used (like, lemon-sized x2) there wasn‚Äôt a huge amount of crunch. Just a few sections. (I have a lot of hair...?)

I've been doing the CG method for \~2 months now and have definitely seen some positive changes. However, my curls (2b/c on the top and 2a/b on the bottom, but getting curlier) seem to fall out so quickly! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have mid-back length hair that's coarse+thick, so I always dry with a soft bonnet dryer to help fight gravity. Everything looks really curly at that point, but after I SOTC, my curls go flat and loosen quite a bit.  Is this inevitable given how long my hair is, or should I use more/stronger gel?

3457,4,7,3,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/90byb2/advice_for_wavy_fine_hair/e2ppqx9/,"I have really fine 2B/C waves and it took a long time for me to figure out which products my hair liked AND held for most of the day. I actually don't even use a diffuser anymore, and only plop and air dry while using butterfly clips for my roots! 

1. I wash my hair with silicone and sulfate free conditioner (Tresemme Boutanique - the coconut one) ONLY. I never use shampoo (even if it's CG friendly) because I've found that it makes my hair too dry. Detangle while the conditioner is in, wash ALL the conditioner out, flip my hair over my head, then squish in about a quarter size amount of the same conditioner while the hair is sopping wet.
2. Get out the shower, and apply a thumb size amount of **Devacurl B-Leave In** using the praying hands method. Scrunch to encourage the curl.
3. Plop in a t-shirt for 15-20 min.
4. Un-plop, shake out curls, and flip hair to the left. Apply a chickpea sized amount of **LA Looks gel (blue one)** by scrunching it into my hair. Flip to right and do the same, with another chickpea of gel. Flip hair over head and apply another chickpea of gel. 
5. Part hair to my natural part. Use butterfly clips at roots, and let it airdry completely. Sometimes I use a fan on low speed and let it marinate in front of it for a soft diffuse and some favored frizz.
6. When it's dry, take out the clips, flip your head over and shake out your hair by shaking them at the roots with your hands. Flip hair back, scrunch out crunch on left and right and voila!

It sounds like a long process but honestly this is the LEAST time-consuming method I've tried! And it saves me a lot of money cos I only use three products. :)

33094,5,3,7,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/a4f2ny/8_years_cg_and_im_lost/,"8 years CG and I'm LOST!Hello everyone, super new user here, I am hoping to get some help. I heard this is the place to be for curly hair. 

So I started CG about 8 years ago when my curls were getting looser/dry, and I've admittedly been pretty lazy about it. I found a few things that were CG friendly and that about ended my research. However something happened to my hair lately and it's changed and I'm totally lost. I have almost given up hope that this can work for me and I am so frustrated that I almost want to go to the extreme and straighten my hair all the time even though I have never done that my whole life. Here's the rundown:

&amp;#x200B;

My hair ranges from 2a (under layer) to 3a and is very fine. It used to be more 3b in my teens and twenties. I believe I am low porosity but I am still working on figuring that out. My shafts are smooth but it takes some time for my hair to get wet. For years I have been using Suave coconut conditioner to co-wash, GVP Matrix Biology conditioner, Kinky Curly as leave it, Herbal Essence Set Me Up gel. My only complaint with this was that I had pretty bad flakes on my scalp, even just after washing. A few months ago I tried using the Harmons version of the DC low poo shampoo and when I look back now I am wondering if this is what started the change. My scalp did get better doing this and using the Paul Mitchell tea tree oil treatment which I haven't had to use in months. Since I noticed the change however I dc'd the low poo shampoo and went back to cowashing with the coconut conditioner. I sometimes cowash with my bfs whole foos protein conditioner. I have tried LA Looks gel, Aussie Instant free gel and mousse, I rotate those occasionally. I tried Deva Curl stuff and hated it. I rarely get a cast. LA looks is the only one that can do that but when it happens I cannot SOTC fully especially on the ends.

What I noticed originally was that the crown of my head felt gummy post wash. When I started googling why it seemed as though I had too much moisture going on. I realized I didn't really have any protein in my routine. So I got a deep conditioner (Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Oil one) to add in to my routine. The first time I used it I got great results. Shiny curls. . I also started rotating with some protein conditioners from Whole Foods and even a protein shampoo from there. But then I started noticing some other things happening to my hair. Directly after a shower my hair was almost dry and it was webbing badly. It only webs when wet. So now I am resoaking my hair directly after washing before putting in my LI and products. My hair is not as curly, it doesnt hold a curl for more than a few hours. When it is dry its soft, not brittle, does not web. It's almost fluffy, but it's more like my frizz is light and fluffy.  just bought Righteous Roots oil but I do not know how that will work for me.

So I am lost and don't know what to do. Do I need more protein or more moisture?? What on earth am I doing wrong??

Right now I have 2A waves but my hair is rather mixed with random different textures (I‚Äôve seen 2B as well as some spiraling around one another...have no idea what that means) I have low porosity hair that takes HOURS to dry (timed the other day, 5 hours.) Anyway! My hair acts straight when wet with conditioner. It doesn‚Äôt regain its wave until it‚Äôs damp/nearly  dry.. Is this normal for wavies or is my hair still not moisturized enough? I have had INCREDIBLY dry hair until switching to the CGM a couple weeks ago. I should mention that I am bleach damaged. I have seen HUGE improvements and my hair has never looked happier! I am seeking more definition and I was simply curious why my hair looks so straight when wet. It‚Äôs almost like my hair gets waterlogged.

One more question: For the DevaCurl Light Defining Gel is it alright for me to defuse or scrunch/blowdry? (I have yet to invest in a diffuser and my hair is MUCH curlier when scrunched and dried with the cool setting) If so, should I let the gel cast set in and break it when diffusing?

37144,5,0,7,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/g7kny1/i_live_in_the_desert_and_my_curl_wont_hold_what/,"I live in the desert, and my curl won‚Äôt hold. What styling products should I be using?so, I‚Äôm originally from the southeast US where it‚Äôs very humid, and for the past 3 years I‚Äôve lived in the desert where it‚Äôs always dry and there‚Äôs basically no humidity. since moving here, my curl pattern has changed and my hair won‚Äôt hold the curl like, at all. I used to be able to go 2-3 days without washing or losing much curl. my hair looks okay when it‚Äôs freshly washed and styled, but if I go outside (it‚Äôs always breezy here) for five minutes my hair loses most of its curl. it also loses its curl on day 2 no matter what I do - I do the pineapple thing and sleep on satin pillowcases. I‚Äôm not sure if my hair needs more moisture or protein. whenever I do the porosity test I get a different result every time. I tried CGM for a few months and didn‚Äôt see any benefit. 

I‚Äôm mostly wondering if I should be using different products for better hold, or if I should try a denman brush to distribute product better. I was a wash n go person for a long time so I haven‚Äôt tried many products. I currently use a curling cream but I need to switch to something fragrance-free; idk if I should go for another cream, a gel, or a mousse. my curl pattern is probably a 3B on a good day, but when it loses curl it looks more like 2A or 2B. 

routine:
- wash every couple days with Trader Joe‚Äôs tea tree shampoo + conditioner 
- sometimes I co wash about once a week but not regularly
- while hair‚Äôs wet, scrunch in OGX argan oil curling cream 
- plop in a t-shirt for 10-15 min, &amp; diffuse with cool air (sometimes I let it air dry)

I chopped it from mid back into a bob, bleached it to hell, and all curl was lost. In a last-ditch effort, I plunged into CGM four months ago, and have had really amazing hair and my curl pattern has never been this consistent. I‚Äôm a 3a/3b and my whole life I thought I was a limp 2c. I‚Äôve also been using Olaplex 3 and my hair is seriously so happy. 

The conundrum: dryness. Before CGM, I struggled with this (my hair never gets oily, just dry). Now, it was better, but a few weeks ago my boyfriend was playing with my and his wife‚Äôs hair and commented that mine felt like straw in comparison. The thing is, he didn‚Äôt mean it as a rude thing, just like an observation. I touched hers and then mine and realized he was completely right. So even with my amazing, bouncy curls (seriously, my curls never used to bounce back ‚Äî *no* elasticity), they‚Äôre still dry asf. And this was literally the day after deep conditioning!!! 

I was so embarrassed that I caved and bought cheap products with silicones, and omg, my hair. It‚Äôs gorgeous. The curls are finally plump, like actually juicy, and they‚Äôre soft. They feel silky, so combined with the bounce and the silky feel, I also am getting good 3 day hair with absolutely zero refresh. I wasn‚Äôt getting good 3 day hair before. It always looked like trash by the end of day 2, plus needing the blessing of a high priestess for the elaborate refreshes to work on day 2. 

So, help?? How can I get this without silicones?!?!? I believe in the CGM, but my hair right now is just so soft and bouncy and plump, I don‚Äôt want to give this up. I‚Äôm currently using: Aussie Miracle Moist shampoo + conditioner. Aussie Miracle Curl Leave-In Milk. LA Looks blue gel. 

CGM routine was always in flux, but my best results were the entire NYM Curl Talk line: shampoo, conditioner, curl cream, gel.

37711,2,3,7,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/crifmh/looking_for_some_help_im_lost/,"Looking for some help! Im lostHello! This is really the first time I have ever in my 20 years dove deep into how to properly take care of my curly hair and wow have I learned so much just from this reddit and youtube! When I was little I barely had any hair and what I did have was straight. However, I was in middle school when the wave and thickness came in but I tragically straightened my hair everyday (making it quite dead). It was not until high school where I began letting the curls go free, but for some reason this is the first time I have ever heard of the curly girl method. I have a lot of questions....

1) Does anyone have any shampoo and conditioner recommendations for me? After looking at mine Ive notice they are filled with sulfates and silicones. I also prefer to wash my hair everyday or every other day (is this allowed?) 

2) How long would you think it would take my hair to fully get right? Is it just a crap shoot? Other than the sulfates and silicones in my hair, I have not touched a straightener since middle school but do get my hair highlighted by my hair dresser. I am worried about that whole possibly greasy, awkward phase. 

3) Does anyone have any styling product or technique recommendations? I had been using the Moroccan oil mouse and curl defining cream for years, come to find out it has silicone in it! Today I tried the devacurl style cream and ultra defining gel and for once had very defined and soft curls! I love it but felt I lacked some volume. 

4) What the heck is plopping and when/how should I do it? 

5) I currently use a wet brush (only when my hair is wet) to detangle, can I still do this? I have tried a wide tooth comb in the past and maybe I just don't know how to brush my hair properly but I rip out more hair. 

I don't know if this will help but from what I gathered I have a mix between 3a, 3b, and 3c curls and medium porosity with it about shoulder length.

Just wanted to share som tips and tricks, just in case any of you have had the same problem. 

I have ""long"" (waist length) curly 3a/3b hair and absolutely hate getting wet, especially on the back after i am all dried up and have to style my hair :( 

So instead of washing your hair and putting in product after the shower you could do the whole routine in the shower, wash, put in leave in, styling products, oils etc.  and wrap your hair and then wash the rest of the body. It might get messy but you can just wash it off after hihi. And the oil protects against heat (Up to the burning point) as well in case you want to blowdry it after. 

Maybe everyone does this hahah, idk",3a,  tipshi     wanted    share    som    tips    tricks     case    problem      long      waist    length     curly    3a 3b    hair    absolutely    hate    getting    wet     especially    back    dried    style    hair          instead    washing    hair    putting    product    shower    could    whole    routine    shower     wash     put    leave    in     styling    products     oils    etc     wrap    hair    wash    rest    body     might    get    messy    wash    hihi     oil    protects    heat     up    burning    point     well    case    want    blowdry    after     maybe    everyone    hahah     idk  ,tipshi wanted share som tip trick case problem long waist length curly 3a 3b hair absolutely hate getting wet especially back dried style hair instead washing hair putting product shower could whole routine shower wash put leave in styling product oil etc wrap hair wash rest body might get messy wash hihi oil protects heat up burning point well case want blowdry after maybe everyone hahah idk,tipshi wanted share som tip trick case problem long waist length curly 3a 3b hair absolutely hate getting wet especially back dried style hair instead washing hair putting product shower could whole routine shower wash put leave styling product oil etc wrap hair wash rest body might get messy wash hihi oil protects heat burning point well case want blowdry maybe everyone hahah idk,Daily Routines,Cutting/Growing,Advice for Textured Hair,Drying Routines

you're best off not worrying about curl type, though. copy pasted from [the FAQ in the CG handbook doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.b23djzn2e6n):

&gt;Someone created a curl identification system to determine the ""type"" of one's curl. We recommend not worrying about what ""type"" you are because:

1. It doesn't help you decide what products or techniques to use
2. Your hair will almost definitely change as you take better care of it. [See this example of one person's hair. The left image is fluffy, maybe a bit of texture, curl type 1A if that, right? But the next picture is only a few months later, following CG techniques and using only CG-approved products. Suddenly 2b, 2c with one or two 3a and 2a sprinkled in!](https://imgur.com/ozDZBsS)
3. Most people have a mix of curl types on their head, or don't neatly fit into a single category.

I've been reading you for a while but this is my first post! Thank you all for your work, it's incredible and this is a really warming community.

I've doing the CGM for a couple of months and the results are amazing. I have a very long (around 85cm), thin, 2C to 3A, high porosity hair. No dyes and no heat damage, just very dry.

A few weeks ago I decided to upgrade my routine with *drum roll* an expensive mask (well, for me it's expensive, I'm currently unemployed and with my amount of hair, masks don't last long). I went to a specialized shop in my neighborhood and asked for help, and they gave me [Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Mask](https://www.sheamoisture.com/jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-and-restore-treatment-masque/764302215554.html). I tried and OMG the nutrition and the proteins and everything. I love it and gives me great hydration but it's too packed with oils for my thin hair and I think is weighing my curls down. Not that I have a problem with oils, but I'm usually fine with a couple drops of lineseed and avocado. This is definitely for a coarse hair.

Next time I pick a good mask I will definitely do my own research, but for now I would like to keep using it (it cost me almost 20$). Can I mix it with water so the amount of oil is not that much?

Personally, I felt the same way in the beginning and was shocked to hear how much gel/mousse/whatever people were using for hair my length (barely shoulders). I would suggest giving some gel a try. I end up looking like a curly wet dog while it‚Äôs drying, but the scrunch out the crunch thing is no joke and I end up with really nice curls. I think a lot of people use the LA Looks blue gel (someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong!!) because it‚Äôs very inexpensive. 

My routine:
Co-wash with Shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil conditioner, wide-toothed comb to spread evenly, rinse out with my head upside down. Apply she‚Äôs moisture coconut curl smoothie (good ball sized dollop), wide toothed comb to evenly spread product. Then, I finger curl big chunks to encourage clumping. I then use a little less than a golf ball deva curl light hold  and coat the curl chunks.  Plop in a twistie turbie, plop in a cotton long-sleeve shirt, air dry bc I am usually too lazy to diffuse and no one gives me a hard time about wet hair at work. 

Once it‚Äôs dry, I scrunch out the crunch and either use a scalp massager or my fingers to lift at the roots. This does cause a little bit of frizz, but the curl shape is worth it. 

My hair is shoulder length, fine, 2c/3a low porosity.

The only problem I have is that I can't get the top layer of my hair to curl at the roots. Typically, the bottom layers would have very nice curls starting near the roots, but at the top, they're more wavy and the wave begin at around 1-2 inches from the root :( 

My hair is layered, with the front layers being even shorter as to frame the face so it shouldn't be weighing down. Does anyone have a solution for this? I typically have my hair in a half-updo so it stays out of my face but I would like to have it down from time to time :(

Weirdly enough, at the back of my head, the curls start near the roots, even at the top layer. It's basically my sides and the front of my hair that has this problem.

Sorry I don't have pics of myself atm but this is basically what I'm dealing with: [https://imgur.com/a/yQcTOPw](https://imgur.com/a/yQcTOPw) (in my case, the hair is smooth and straigter at the roots at the top layer, only in the front, and curly roots underneath).

22210,7,3,4,0,/r/curlyhair/comments/g6mb99/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/foaxzln/,"Hi all! I‚Äôm trying to incorporate a pre poo into my routine and wonder the order of products I should use, what exactly constitutes as a pre-poo, and where does olaplex fall into the mix?

Right now my routine is:

1.	Wet my hair with a spray bottle and Pre-poo with DevaCurl no-poo (it‚Äôs just what I have on hand from months ago and I feel like I read someone using this as a pre-poo?)
2.	Detangle with a tangle teaser comb thing
3.	Put on olaplex throughout my hair and comb it through. Let it sit for about 20 minutes
4.	get in the shower, rinse everything out. Exfoliate my scalp with Eva nyc deeptox exfoliating salt shampoo (bi weekly)
5.	Shampoo with NYM natural Tahitian Gardenia flower &amp; mango butter curl defining shampoo and then rinse it all out
6.	condition and detangle with Naturals Tahitian Gardenia Flower &amp; Mango Butter Curl Defining Conditioner and leave it in while finishing up shower stuff
7.	squish to condish all the conditioner out
8.	deep condition with TGIN Honey Miracle Hair Mask Deep Conditioner and put my hair into six or seven twists. Let it sit for an hour or so depending how lazy I am lol sometimes I use one of those hooded dryer tent things for 20 minutes instead 
9.	Rinse out all of the deep conditioner (squish2condish)
10. Put in a little more of the NYM conditioner
11. Apply in sections the following: Green Tea Super Moist Leave In Conditioner
12. Uncle Funky‚Äôs brilliant shine butter cream
13. Uncle Funky‚Äôs curly magic curl stimulator
14. Diffuse if I‚Äôm not lazy or air dry if I am


So basically rate my routine and maybe suggest any changes? My hair is like a 3c/4a id say. Maybe with some 3b mixed in? I‚Äôm also having trouble with dry and frizzy hair underneath in literally one section. I can provide pictures if it‚Äôll help!

I normally just pop them in a messy bun on day two or something but the frizz halo looks awful!!
I sleep with a pineapple in, and try and refresh the gel cast with water the next day. I've even bought some Cantu Comeback Curl spray from Superdrug but this does nothing apart from make it smell nice.

32535,4,2,6,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/gp710y/cutting_2c_hair/,"Cutting 2c hairHello there,

One of my quarantine buddies (QB) has long (past the shoulders), thick, 2c hair. 

Normally, we would never dream of cutting this ourselves. But QB needed a haircut right before lockdown, and now QB's hair is really heavy and uncomfortable.

The plan is for some combination of people to cut QB's hair eventually, so I've been trying to read up on what to do-- but I've read a lot of contradictory advice (""you absolutely have to cut it wet!"" ""You absolutely have to cut it dry!"") and I'm even more confused than when I started.

QB wants to keep the length, more or less, just less weight. It's *really really* important not to mess it up, because I know that QB will be sad/self-conscious if I do a bad job.

27202,3,7,5,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/a3rcqy/can_i_use_a_conditioner_with_silicones_to/,"Can I use a conditioner with silicones to detangle before a clarifying wash?I've been strictly following the no silicone rule for a few weeks now since I started the CG method. My hair is amazing now and I still need to work on moisturizing, but so far so good.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a cheap, cruelty-free conditioner to use for detangling but I've been seeing that conditioner with silicones has the most slip. My hair gets horribly tangled so I need something with a lot of slip. I was wondering if detangling with silicones then doing a clarifying wash right after will be fine or will I still see some effects from the silicones since it was used right before clarifying?

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2b/2c curls with low porosity. I would say its fine/normal but I've had some hair lose over the past few years. It's still very dehydrated but getting better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Routine:

\-Wash with VO5 clarifying shampoo (currently waiting on a build up buster to come in and I only wash once a week)

\-Apply loads of DevaCurl Decadence conditioner

\-Detangle with fingers and wide tooth comb

\-Squish to condish and leave a little as a leave-in

\-Apply JessiCurl Rockin Ringlets styling potion and DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel to wet hair

\-Squish out left over water and product

\-Air dry and a few minutes of cool diffusing 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is relevant, but I'm also waiting for DevaCurls Deep Sea Repair and Melt into Moisture deep conditioner (along with the build up buster).

&amp;#x200B;

After starting my routine I realized how badly silicones affected my hair so I'm worried about using one to detangle. Would I be okay using it before a clarifying wash? Or does anyone have any cheap cruelty-free, silicone-free conditioner with lots of slip?

I've been losing volume and definition and it feels like my curls/waves have been getting looser over the last month.

First pic was from February. I was using products that were too heavy for my hair and I had to clarify once a week. Routine: SM moisture retention shampoo, SM Jamaican black castor oil conditioner (hadn't learned squish to condish yet), and detangle while conditioning. I didn't try to keep it in curl clumps and I also never used a deep conditioner. After the shower, I'd apply a quarter sized amount of Cantu moisturizing curl activator cream and a palmful of LA looks blue gel, using praying hands and scrunching. Plop for 20 minutes then diffuse until 100% dry. I believe this pic was taken on a day I clarified.

The past month or so the pieces around my face have gone from 2b/2c to 2a. In this time I figured out the shampoo/conditioners were giving me more moisture than I needed and causing the intense buildup. I've also learned some better techniques I've started implementing in my wash routine.

My current routine: Suave essentials coconut conditioner as a cowash. I scrub the scalp and then apply conditioner to the ends and comb out tangles with a Goody brand wet brush. Flip my head upside down, brush again. While still upside down, squish to condish, wash out most of the conditioner, and try to keep the hair in clumps as much as possible. While my hair's still soaking wet I apply a dime sized amount of Cantu curl activator cream to my ends, scrunch, apply a palmful of LA looks blue gel with praying hands and scrunch. Plop for 20 minutes and diffuse until 80-90% dry and clip the roots until fully dry.

I'm not sure what to do to get them to tighten up again, and I've lost a lot of volume. My curls will also fall out much more than they used to for second and third day. Clarifying doesn't make any difference and neither does deep conditioning or using a non-sulfate shampoo. A little extra info about my hair: I've got low-porosity roots and high-porosity ends thanks to some old bleach damage. I'm pretty sure I'm 2b/2c with some 3a bits.

Any help or general advice would be greatly appreciated!

17465,1,2,4,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/d00lop/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/ezko4ox/,"Curl types are just for fun!

1=straight hair
2=wavy hair
3=curly hair 
4=kinky/coily hair

A, B, C are subcategories. A is the least and C is the most. So 2A is the minimal amount of wave/closest to straight hair and 4C is the tightest type of curl, including a z-type shape.

3A-C to me is generally spirally. 

It's common to have multiple hair types, sometimes divided by the different parts of your hair (ex. Crown vs closest to your neck vs the rest of your hair). So like for me I'd say I have a range of 2C, 3A, 3B. Some people have more uniform hair.


Hair type CAN corellate with porosity and hair level, but it's not a hard rule. Ex. Finer hair might tend to be more porous and in need of protein while kinkier/coarser hair might be less porous and need moisture and little if any added protein.  But it's not always a straight match up.


Knowing how fine/thick your hair is, how porous it is, and hair much protein it needs (or doesn't) is gnerally more useful.

I have coarse 2b-3A hair, i think very porous. 

I went CG 1.5 years ago. The first 6 months were great, I was following the beginners guide (Tresemme Conditioner and LA Looks gel). It kept getting better and better. 

But around 6 months in, I slowly started losing definition, getting way more frizz and fluffiness. I tried new leave-ins, thinking it was just dry... that made it WORSE. My hair was super soft and light, almost too soft. I almost gave up.

Then I learned about over-moisturizing. Sounded like my hair... So I tried Apogee 2 min karatin treatment. It helped a little! But not enough and it wouldn‚Äôt last. So I tried Ion 2 step protein repair. That also helps but doesn‚Äôt last. 

The only way I can get my hair to be presentable is with loads of gel, and even then, if I so much as look at it wrong, it turns into that finger-in-socket frizz look. 

AND! My clean hair with no product in it looks way worse than before I started CG, back when it was damaged. It looks like I dry brushed it even when I don‚Äôt. 

Any advice? I feel like I‚Äôve lost all progress and made it even less healthy than back when I was straightening it most days.

When I look at pictures from a few years ago BEFORE I started CG, I like and miss the volume I had then (my curl pattern ranges from 2a-2c right now, but looked more solidly 2b-2c then, better clumps). 

The thing is, I know my hair is healthier now. At the time I'm referencing, I had a lot of highlighting and damage from that. It was dry and brittle and you can see that from looking at it in these pictures...but the volume! And it held curl better. My cut is very similar to then, maybe a couple inches shorter, but still long. My hair is dense, and I think the strands vary in texture with my curl pattern - 2c areas seem more coarse, 2a areas might even be fine. 

I don't want the damaged look back, of course, but isn't there a happy medium where I can make it look more...fluffy? I feel like it looks limp now. 

I'm trying to work through whether this was maybe a porosity issue that I've over-corrected? Could it be that it was high porosity then, but my babying it the last few years (much more careful with coloring and using repairing and protective products, CG products, almost no heat styling at all, etc.) has repaired that to the point of medium or low porosity? 

When I run my fingers up a single strand, it squeaks. It does take hours and hours to air dry (easily 4+, but it's also dense). I feel like maybe it does take a while to get it wet in the shower. I don't necessarily have the impression that product sits on top (no flakes), but it does seem like all product is too heavy, too much. 

My gut feels like my hair never feels as clean as I want it to. And like any product I use (gel, mousse, leave-in, together or separate) just weighs it down. If I follow the beginners guide strictly, I get stringy, wet- and greasy-looking ""curls."" My hair just looks dirty with the LA gel. 

I've only been washing every 5-7 days and maybe not clarifying as often as I should. Maybe I need to trial every 3-4 days and make sure I'm clarifying once per month at least. Does that sound like the right track? 

Or am I chasing something that my hair just can't do when it's healthy? Maybe I just don't have a hair type that can be both healthy and have the volume I'm looking for at the same time?

Also! When you rinse the conditioner out, don‚Äôt rinse it completely‚Äî leave some in. The Squish to Condish method is very well loved by curlies‚Äî you can look up the technique on YouTube!

37255,4,7,2,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/gps3rj/does_anyone_know_what_hair_type_i_am/,"Does anyone know what hair type i am?HELLO! so I have never really been able to tell based on the curly girl charts everyone goes by because i think my hair may be a combination of things. I feel like when it's recently washed it has the porosity of type 3A and feels very thin (pics 1-2), and if I blow dry without scrunching it can look fairly wavy (pic 3). but by day 2 or 3 with product and scrunching, it is def ringlet style and starts to frizz so it looks 3B maybe (the third picture)? However, it's not very voluminous like the stereotypical mixed 3bc/4a hairtype which is frustrating because i always try products to see if i can get it to look like that. For context i've never had anything done to my hair besides flat ironing it a bunch growing up, so it is possible that my ""True"" texture isn't revealed because of the heat damage?? But i don't have any chemicals in it and have never relaxed or anything of the nature (though people love to always touch my hair and make really ignorant comments asking about race etc since they are shocked when i tell them it's not relaxed smh). In fact these photos are after i cut 7 inches off to get rid of most of the stringy bits and split ends from straightening it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is also confusing because no one else really has the same type in my family. my dad has fairly straight hair but my mom, sister and brother both have 3C/4A.  The last pic of is of me and my sister with her face blurred lol. 

also my current routine is: wash it like 3 times a week with shea moisture jamaican black castor oil shampoo and conditioner set. Then i just air dry or diffuse it. If anyone has hair like mine can they say what type it is and what their curly routine is? Thanks in advanced :)

Either way new to this group! Liking all the curly hair advice since I'm new to having curly hair (used to buzz cut since I can remember because I was too lazy to have and take care of hair). Grew the hair and beard out and loving it! Still a lot to learn. Moisture is key for sure. When I started growing it out it was a rat's nest and I was so confused as to what was wrong with my hair (siblings have maybe type 2C at most hair) while using cheap conditioners and shampoos (with all the bad ingredients).

Thank you in advance for any and all information!

HAIR TYPE: 
mostly 2c w/ 2b on the more damaged areas (I also have a few random curls on the left top layer that are 3a)
Normal-High porosity (hair is still damaged, but getting better everyday)
Low hair density

PRODUCTS USED: 
*I don't use all of these at once but these are the products I'm testing currently""

Shampoo and conditioner:
Not Your Mother's Clean Freak Shampoo &amp; conditioner
Hask repair conditioner

Deep Conditioner: 
Hask Argan oil deep Conditioner

Leave in conditioner I've used:
-Ion miracle leave in conditioner with coconut (not a fan, my hair sticky and dry)
-Shea Moisture Miracle Styler leave in treatment (it's just okay,)
-one n' only Argan Oil 12-in-1 daily treatment (this has been my absolute favorite!)


Heat protector/root spray: 
Keranique Lift &amp; Repair
Gariner fructis heat protection spray (blanking on the name still the moment, sorry)

To style:
-Herbal Essences totally twisted mousse (been my favorite so far, but SO FRIZY)
-Suave max hold alcohol free gel
-gariner fructis conditioning gel (only used once so far and I def used to much on accident, but it seems really promising!)


I typically wash my hair once a week with shampoo &amp; co-wash 2 or 3 times a week. I detangle in the shower then apply my leave in conditioner, then mousse or gel and scrunch. Out of the shower I apply the root lift/heat protection and sometimes I will decide to add some gel try to twist some of the strands on the back of my head that never want to clump into nice curls, then scrunch some more. I ""plop"" my hair with a slick microfiber towel and air dry as much as time will allow. If I use a diffuser I normally use the ""no heat"" setting the majority of the time with small amounts of low heat.",2b,  hair    feel    kinda    sticky    tangles    easilu i ve    rocking

My hair seemed low porosity because it doesn‚Äôt break, floats, and takes forever to get wet. However it is very very dry. 

My routine here was shea moisture low porosity shampoo and conditioner, left in a little conditioner after stc,  devacurl wavemaker and shea moisture curling smoothie applied to soaking wet hair using stc. Curls goddess blueberry bliss gel and herbal essences mousse while hair was wet, and then a small amount of LA looks applied to nearly dry hair in which I squished a little more water. 

I know it‚Äôs a lot of product but my waves fall out easily into frizz and this was the most definition in the front I‚Äôve been able to get. In the back I have more 2c/3a hair under the top layer. 

Recently I tried the shea Jamaican castor oil to good effect- my hair is much smoother and shinier and healthy looking but it‚Äôs still hard to hold any wave pattern. Advice?

2789,5,3,2,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/g74h05/curlywavy_hair_transitioning/fof1hv3/,"&gt; I found a hair mask that‚Äôs supposed to help your hair grow faster 

i'm highly skeptical of this lmao. it's not your fault, but the thing is, hair growth happens inside your scalp. nothing you apply outside your scalp will have any sort of affect on hair growth. the speed at which hair grows is mostly genetic anyway, and it's not really something you can change

&gt;I literally don‚Äôt know where to start so I guess my first questions would be ‚Äúhow and where do I start?‚Äù 

check out the stickied post on top of the sub called [""start here! beginner info""](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/g6mb99/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/) and that should get you started on the curly girl method!

&gt;I was also thinking about trying an apple cider vinegar + baking soda hair mask that apparently helps your hair curl (I saw it on TikTok so I don‚Äôt know if I should actually trust it lol). 

i would not recommend this, the pH is baking soda is much higher than the pH of hair, and so as a result it's way too alkaline to be used on hair

&gt; I was thinking of replacing the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a 10‚Äù with Miss Jessie‚Äôs Pillow Soft Curls, adding a gel to my routine, try plopping my hair, and after quarantine get a long layered haircut. 

these are good ideas though!

&gt; I couldn‚Äôt really find an accurate curly hair type chart, so I‚Äôm guessing my current hair looks 2a-2b and the curls I got in my hair look 2c-3b. I have no idea if this is actually accurate or not though.

4694,7,5,4,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/apak4o/day_2_of_cgm_way_curlier_but_need_help_with/eg6wapj/,"Yesterday I started curly girl method. But after I clarified I didn't deep condition and my curls barely lasted (didn't add enough gel either). So today I co-washed and did a deep conditioning (Tres semme Nourish &amp;Replenish, honey and olive oil for 30 min) and did more gel..got way better curls but still not as soft as I want. 

Routine: Co-wash with tres semme, condition upside down, detangle and squish to condish. Add LA Looks perfect curl gel with praying hands and squish (with palm). Plop in turbie towel for 30 minutes and let air dry. I'm not great at keeping my hands off my hair plus I know a diffuser would help as my hair takes forever to dry.

I think I have 2b hair? And normal porosity. 

I mostly followed the beginners guide on here and I've already got incredible results, I'm just curious what I can do better.

I pineapple and sleep on a 100% bamboo pillow case, considering a silk cap for night. 

When I gel my hair I have incredible huge clumps and by the time it dries it's quite stringy.

I've read a lot about a Den something brush..but I know you're also not supposed to brush? I used to use a boar bristle brush that made my hair incredibly soft and smooth.

I actually got something to finally work yesterday.


Routine I Usually Do:

Devacurl No-poo &amp; their One Conditioner (the orig. ones), followed by their Styling Cream, and then either their light or ultra defining gel (I prefer the light over ultra. Better hold for me and doesn‚Äôt make my curls/waves weighed down). I also do protein treatments followed by moisturizing deep conditioning treatments once a week or so. The protein treatments have really helped some of my curls on the top layer spring back up. 


Routine I Did Yesterday:

I got a little carried away with putting oils on (jojoba &amp; Vit E), so my hair got super oily. Just drenched. So decided to use the DevaCurl Buildup Buster in place of the No-poo to help wash out some of the excess oil. I followed with the One Conditioner using the Squish 2 Condish method to apply it. Next, I used just a couple of drops of Argan Oil rubbed together in my palms to seal the moisture in my hair. I just carefully smoothed over my canopy with the oil and underneath and then got a tiny bit more on my hands &amp; scrunched it in. I also used some to smooth over the ends at the very bottom and over the top layer where I have split ends and breakage. 

Next, scrunched the excess water out with a microfiber towel. Got out of shower and finger combed through my hair, making sure to spread it out for better distribution of styling products. Applied DevaCurl Styling Cream using the praying hands Method. Then scrunched upward. Kept scrunching until tight waves &amp; ringlets started to reform. Used same towel again to scrunch out any excess product. Plopped with long sleeve t-shirt for about 10 minutes or so. Scrunched with towel again. Then used dryer on low speed/cool &amp; diffused hair to almost dry. 

I think finally doing the Squish to Condish method correctly for the first time and adding in the Argan oil to seal made the most difference. My hair was so soft and defined. Even the top layer with minimal frizz. So definitely look up YouTube videos on how to do the Squish 2 Condish correctly because I think that‚Äôs key to really getting the moisture into your hair. 

Sorry for the novel above. (I tend to be long-winded üòâ) But since it sounds like we have such similar hair with the same problems, I wanted to share with you exactly what I did to get vastly better results.

I've only really embraced my natural waves in the past year or so and I'm still learning how to maintain them. My hair is a weird mix of 2a/2b in the top layer and near my face and 2c/3a-ish in the bottom layer. I like how my hair looks when I wash (with L'oreal everpure line and Lus leave in) and air dry, but as soon as the next morning rolls around my hair is a tangled disaster. I really don't know what to do between washes. While it's summer where I am and dampening it every day could work for now, I live in a colder climate and it would be too cold for me to do that for 6 months out of the year (and my hair would freeze in the winter months). Right now I've been putting it up when I sleep and combing it with my fingers or with a wide-toothed comb in the morning, but my hair is still horribly tangled until I eventually get tired of it, brush it and put it in a ponytail or bun until I wash it again.

My dumb question is... if she has a haircut, let's say I cut of the bottom 2/3rds of her hair, would the rest start to curl as it got longer? Or would she only have straight hair now?!

I've been doing the curly girl method for a few months now with some borderline approved-ish drugstore products from Germany, but the formula has changed and I got split ends for the first time in one or two years. I didn't know what else to buy, it kind of worked and all that, but I wasn't happy with it. Anyway, I want to change the products I'm using to ones that are actually curly girl approved, the right type for my hair and hopefully not too expensive. 

So, apparently I have medium to high porosity, super low elasticity, dry 2A/2B hair.
I don't really understand what kind of haircare I need for this hairtype and before I go on and purchase something that'll ruin my hair because it's meant for a different hairtype, I decided to consult the people of this sub because damn, y'all have beautiful hair and even if I can't reach maximum curl power, I want to at least have healthy looking and more defined hair.

Just sharing my thoughts right now as a reformed curly girl. I was mostly no heat 3B/C hair up until 2018, when I started working at a blow dry bar and training to be a hairdresser. Being around so many hairdressers made it so easy for me to use heat on my hair, and over the past two years I've found myself straightening my hair more and more.. to the point that I couldn't find any pictures with curly hair from late 2019! It's crazy because I love my curls and it's something people usually recognise me by, but I started reverting back to a teenage version of myself that just didn't embrace the curl. I even started to think I looked better with straight hair. Anyway, just before quarantine I got a trim and I haven't put any heat in my hair for 2 months.. I hope to continue and really start to appreciate my curls again. I might not use heat at all for the rest of the year.

I‚Äôm unsure how to determine porosity - I tried the hair floating test and I‚Äôm pretty sure it floated - either way, I know my hair is resistant to moisture and that is why it remains dry and frizzy no matter how much conditioner or hair masks I use.

I‚Äôve done the cg method for about a year now, and my hair is no better. I think it‚Äôs worse.

I cowash by using suave coconut one or the v05 strawberry. Sometimes use the not your mothers shampoo or clarify with the vo5. Flip my hair upside down and all that jazz in the shower, leave on conditioner, and plop. I‚Äôve tried plopping overnight or for 20 minutes but there‚Äôs no difference. I also use the herbal essence mousse that is cg friendly and the knot today leave in conditioner.

My main problem is that my hair is always tangly. I use so much conditioner I‚Äôm not even sure how it‚Äôs possible.

I had to stay over at a friends and used her head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner and my hair was finally tangle free and felt amazing. So is this method not for me? Does my hair do better with silicone and what not?

35135,2,4,1,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/fpgdre/ive_successfully_murdered_my_curls/,"I‚Äôve successfully murdered my curls :(Hi guys! This is my first post here, I‚Äôve not really been on this sub before but I‚Äôm so sad and need to tell someone. I (23F) have 2C/3A curls and I‚Äôve been pretty content with my hair for the last 2ish years. 

Well, two months ago I cut my hair short from over shoulder length to a 50s ‚Äúchin length but fluffy‚Äù haircut. I should say that it turned out shorter than I wanted it to (hairdresser clearly didn‚Äôt know how to cut curls and misjudged how much they‚Äôd spring up when dry), but it was okay, I could make it work. 

But I‚Äôve been staying with my parents for the past month - a combination of the quarantine and the bathroom in my flat being under renovations and currently unusable - and because I‚Äôm an idiot I only brought my conditioner. My hair is pretty sturdy and I can easily mistreat it for two weeks but... apparently I‚Äôve now reached the limit of what my hair can take :( Normally I use a Sulfate-but-no-silicones shampoo, conditioner, a hair mask, a spray that‚Äôs both a detangler and a leave in conditioner (Lowkey shit though, would not recommend), and hair cream or mousse; plus the occasional coconut oil massage. 

Now, after a month of not adding any product?? It‚Äôs frizzy, my curls are limp, my curl pattern turned into a mess, and did I mention the FRIZZ?? My mum brushes her curls out (kills my soul tbh) so she doesn‚Äôt have any products that could help me, and I finally went to get some stuff now. Soaked my poor hair in coconut oil just now and now I smell like a giant, sad coconut.

12785,2,7,0,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/evj7v3/does_anyone_know_how_to_fix_these_short_frizzy/ffw1950/,"I‚Äôve always had this short, frizzy, brittle section at the front of my head since I was a young child. It‚Äôs also lighter than the rest of my hair (so thinking it may be damaged and possibly thinned), and also it never seems to grow! 

Usually it looks worse than this but this was just before I washed it so it had a little natural oil weighing it down a bit. 

My current routine is: 

- Anti-Dandruff shampoo and condition (I don‚Äôt use any in particular), then rinse 
- Scrunch with cotton t-shirt, apply gel (Garnier Fructis Style Sculpting Ezra Strong) then scrunch with hands 
- Plop (time differs every time, I just do it for however long but usually about an hour)
- Air dry then scrunch out the crunch 

My hair doesn‚Äôt seem to like leave in conditioners, creams, mousse or anything as it always gets weighed down. So just those three products. 

I think I have 2C/3A hair. Not sure about porosity (although I think these frizzy, brittle bits are high porosity. They always dry pretty much straight away whilst the rest takes probably 2-3 hours).

I‚Äôve 2b and a mix of 2c waves as my hair pattern so I chose products which don‚Äôt really weigh my curls down. 
1) Pre-poo: mixed 5-6 drops of tea tree oil with a coconut oil carrier and massaged it gently onto my scalp. Encased my head in a hot towel for about 15 minutes. 
2)Shampoo: I don‚Äôt like to apply chemicals directly onto my scalp. I use soap but powder to wash my scalp and clean out the oil. I did this once gently and rinsed away the residue. 
3)conditioner: I used the ‚ÄúEnliven Raspberry Fruit Extract conditioner‚Äù along the length of my hair and untangled my hair using my fingers. I left it on for 15 minutes before I cleansed it out completely. 
4) STC : I used ‚ÄúAshba Botanics Right Ringlets leave in conditioner‚Äù for the squish to condish process. I sectioned my hair before applying the leave in and STC process. (Indian Brand) 
5) I used ‚Äúa coin sized amount of ‚ÄúArata gel with flaxseed extracts‚Äù and spread it across my palms and applied it using the prayer movement of hands all over the length of my hair and then popped my hair up for about 15 minutes in an old tshirt.

So I never really care about my curly hair for a while, and I just kinda did whatever to it but recently I won a raffle for Aveda ""Be Curly"" hair products and the second I used nice shampoo I was hooked. Anyways I'm a white 16 year old and I've never really damaged my hair too badly other than maybe blow drying it and straightening it every blue moon. (never colored)

I did some research and found out my curls are a 3C and with the help of some online quizzes figure out I have about normal/low porosity hair (more normal than low) and have low/medium density hair and medium width hair too. My hair is fairly long about three inches past my shoulders and I don‚Äôt know the first thing about styling. I used to use Nexus shampoo and Dove conditioner (the anti frizz one) but now as I said I use the Aveda Be Curly line. Those products are expensive for me for the size and I was wondering if you guys could tell me some good dupes or just good products in general and what a basic hair routine for curly hair is.

I don‚Äôt use any hair masks or anything and I usually towel dry my hair (I know it's terrible) and I'm planning on switching to using a t-shirt to dry my hair. Also, I struggle with frizz a lot because I live in Florida.

 I appreciate any tips and I'm really new to actually doing something with my hair.

You‚Äôll spend a ton less time and money and your end result will be only moderately different. Maybe even better. 

Instead of trying to have perfect curls every day, embrace your day 2, 3 and 4 curls pinned into unique updos or twisted into loose buns. 

It‚Äôs so hard to except fine curly hair, and we are wildly unrepresented and often made to feel like we‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing it wrong‚Äù.  It‚Äôs like being on the verge of greatness, lol. 

My HG:

-Kinky Curly ‚ÄúKnot Today‚Äù (pea sized amount to soaking wet hair)

-Mousse as opposed to gels or creams (the mane choice has a great one)

-Oribe texture spray (lightly on COMPLETELY DRY hair only)

-Curl acceptance

So I went in for a perm. I specifically asked for loose perm but he insisted that since my hair is long, I should go with a tighter curl because in the end it will look like a 3b\~. Well, my hair turned out 3c, and because of the damage, I had to chop off a big part of it and now my hair is just below my shoulders (from being mid back) and 3c. It really does not suit me at all, everyone likes it but I can't even look into the mirror anymore.

However, I always struggled with scalp buildup of conditioner residue and dead skin.

I got sick of it and buzzed it so I could start fresh and really scrub and get all that buildup off. It was gross. 

Since then I have tried to grow it back out, but I always get stuck at having a dirty scalp about a few months in. I thought it was the tressemme conditioner, but switching to others without silicone and other garbage left roughly the same effect.

I have 2c/3a hair and find that when I get it bleached I don‚Äôt experience much damage and my hair still curls well. Does your hairdresser use Olaplex? This makes a big difference in my experience. Getting frequent trims to get rid of the most dead bits at the bottom that don‚Äôt curl really helps me. I still experience a few strands that don‚Äôt curl as well as the rest, but I just ignore them and embrace the variation!

I use products with silicones because my hair just needs the extra moisture and I try my best not to use heat frequently so that the only damage I do is from the bleaching every few months. Right now I wash with Shea moisture manuka honey and yogurt shampoo and conditioner every four days, Miss Jessie‚Äôs pillow soft curls which I rake then scrunch and Moroccan oil treatment to reduce frizz and I get a really nice curl after air drying :)

I would put it on near my roots after my shower on wet hair, and my hair would break significantly less and have healthier looking curls.

2443,5,4,7,6,/r/curlyhair/comments/f131fj/beginning_the_curly_girl_method_for_wavy_hair/fh6jr4d/,"I have 2A/2B waves and I'm still into my CG journey and learning along the way, so I don't have all the answers you seek.  But here are some tips I have learned along the way that might help:

In terms of the dealing adjustment phase, the biggest advice I have is just to expect that there will be some bumps.  One day you will love your hair and think you've finally figured out the right product/technique combination and then the next time you do the exact same thing, it looks --- not as great.  Keep going!  Seriously, don't give up.  Keep trying and learning.

Also along the same lines, know that it will take a while to figure out the right combo of tools, techniques, and products that work best for your hair.  I remember when I first started I got so discouraged since I wasn't getting great results right out of the gate.  I absolutely love the hair victory posts here, and drool over the amazing transformations, but I have to remember that I have years of damage from heat, products, and crappy techniques, and it's not going to be an overnight sensation.

Other things I have learned along the way:

* A diffuser and root clipping are your friends.  At least they are mine.  This helps us get a bit more volume if you tend to have limp waves.  Only use the hair dryer on the lowest heat setting and lowest ""air blast"" setting.
* Most wavies can't handle heavy products like shea butter, coconut oil, and products with a lot of oil in general.  Check out the curlsbot ""Curly Girl Lite"" site for product recommendations.  [https://www.curlsbot.com/cg-lite/](https://www.curlsbot.com/cg-lite/)
* I have found that leave-in conditioner makes my hair too greasy on days 2 and 3, so I don't use it.
* I also don't co-wash for the same reason.  I use a gentle (sulfate &amp; silicone-free) shampoo and wash every 3-4 days.
* Shampoo your scalp and let it run down the rest of your hair. No super-foamy shampoo and scrubbing the heck out of your hair.

17525,0,3,1,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/d42tl8/hard_water/f0t802y/,"I figured I'd post an update and may help other people with the same problem along the way :) So, since the asv rinse didn't work I did a little research on clarifying rinses and came across the baking soda one. Now, I did a bit research about that too and after that I was terrified of the idea to even let it close to my hair. So I went with a clarifying shampoo which I randomly just had lying around my house. I ran it through curlsbot and besides the laureth sulfate, it has no other damaging ingridients (it has cg approved alcohols though). So I gave it a try and conditioned my hair right afterwards and put it in a bun before I did the squish to condish method and rinsed it all out (you don't have to rinse it, my hair just gets really weighed down) and now somehow I have even curlier hair (my roots always only had some 2a waves, now it's almost 3a).

The shampoo I used is the kappus one for body and hair. The 50 ml one was just enough for my hair and only costs 50 cents (I looked it up). Now it is a German company but you can order it online (https://www.amazon.de/Kappus-Lavendel-Vera-K%C3%B6rperlotion-200/dp/B00KTGJC22/ref=mp_s_a_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=Kappus+lavendel+Haut+und+haar&amp;qid=1568917355&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0).

For one thing, does it matter? There are no curly police who will hunt you down if you are ""faking"" your curly hair pattern. But to assuage your concerns, in our experience, no. **CG will enhance your natural pattern, but not fundamentally change it.**

Many of us have introduced the CG method to our straight-haired friends who wanted to be curly. They did the beginner routine, they plopped, they scrunched, they squished for at least a month. Their hair remained straight. So go forth and believe in your curly self!""

35455,2,7,0,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/ghv45i/weatherseasons_changing_affecting_curls/,"Weather/seasons changing affecting curls?Hey all,

My curls have been whack lately. I started transitioning back in late November 2019, and my curls were doing well. They were bouncy, more defined, less frizzy. Since late March til now though, they‚Äôve been looking more wavy and frizzy‚Äî and I can‚Äôt think of what it could be other than the change in the weather and seasons, as I‚Äôve not changed anything in my routine. I live in a very humid state and the temperatures and humidity started rising right around late March, exactly when my hair started getting out of control. I‚Äôve not had a good hair day in weeks. Last night was the first time I finally had some decent hair, but even then it‚Äôs nothing like what it was in the colder months when I started transitioning. I‚Äôve never used any chemicals in my hair, but it‚Äôs heat damaged from years of straightening it. 2C/3A curls, medium to low porosity.

My routine:

pre-poo 1-2x a week using a mix of castor oil and olive or coconut oil. First time doing this though, since February, was 2 washes ago

Shampoo with NYM tahitian treat mango hibiscus shampoo (or something, too long for me to remember). I need to shampoo, cowashing doesn‚Äôt make my hair feel clean at all.

Deep condition with Giovanni smooth as silk deep conditioner, detangle
 
Condition with the basic TRESemme bontaique coconut conditioner‚Äîwash out about 70%

29474,5,7,0,4,/r/curlyhair/comments/gij9rf/can_i_cowash_everyday_sulfate_shampoo_once_a_week/,"Can I co-wash everyday? Sulfate shampoo once a week?I feel that I can never achieve day 2 hair. My hair is 2B-3A, thick and between medium and coarse. I feel that my hair needs to be moisturized by day 2 unless it looks and feels pretty bad. I think my current routine is pretty decent so I don't know if this is due to how I sleep - on my side with a silk pillowcase - or something else.

My current routine is the following:

Pre-poo the night before with an oil blend (brahmi, neem curry leaves, castor and olive oil, lots of different stuff, etc) then shampoo once every two to three weeks with Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo. 

Co-wash every 2-5 days, which recently has been every day. I use As I Am Coconut Co-Wash. 

Condition with Camille Rose Moroccan Pear Conditioning Custard and leave in for 10 minutes OR deep condition with Camille Rose Blue Algae Renew Deep Conditioner with a heat cap for 20-40 minutes. 

Everytime I wash my hair I use two leave-ins: As I Am Classic Leave-in and As I Am's DoubleButter Cream overtop. I apply my leave-in to soaking wet hair and reapply water with a spray bottle as needed. I wait for my hair to dry a bit and put the cream overtop.

When my hair is completely dry I fluff it out.

What could I be doing wrong? I feel that my hair looks great on day 1 when I do my whole routine, but by day 2 it looks atrocious and has to be redone. 

I ordered a satin cap to try and hope that will help. I feel that I know my routine well enough at this point to do it in 30 minutes or so, so time wouldn't be an issue if I DID start doing this routine daily.

33049,2,5,6,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/a0bqz2/is_it_possible_that_stopping_birth_control_has/,"Is it possible that stopping birth control has actually helped my curls?Hi! Here's some background to frame my question:

I have 2c-3a hair. I started birth control when I was very young due to problematic periods, around 10 years ago. Before that, my mom took care of my hair, and she doesn't have curly hair so she always combed it (yep...). Therefore, I kind of ""always"" remember my hair being like it has been the past few years: dry, lacking definition, sort of awful. I first tried CG about 2 years ago, and it definitely felt like there was an improvement, but not enough. I tried different products to no avail, so I had just resigned myself to the fact that my hair might just not be that nice.

However, a month ago I stopped taking birth control and this week I realized that my hair looks noticeably nicer. It feels so soft (except for those dang split ends, but I have an appointment soon) and third day hair is no longer a scary mess. I haven't changed anything in my routine, haven't moved, nothing, so birth control seems like the only likely explanation. My hair looks more hydrated now, I can feel some ""greasiness"" but in a good way, since it was dry as the Sahara up until now. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I have fine medium length 2B-3A hair. Half a year ago when it was up to my chin I dyed my bleach ombr√© out with a black dye at the salon. The majority of my ends are a faded black that blend with my natural black color and everything else from the mid to the root is pure virgin, but I feel like it‚Äôs way too moisturized and silky? I wash every 3-4 days with Cantu‚Äôs Sulfate Free Shampoo and condition with Maui Moisture for a few minutes. For styling I apply a tiny bit of the As I Am Leave-in and then very little Aussie Gel. I haven‚Äôt done a mask in almost 2 weeks and my last protein treatment was the Aphogee 2-step, and I used that almost 3 weeks ago. They‚Äôre all CG, and I have a pretty balanced protein &amp; moisture routine I think. However, my virgin hair feels way too soft and so do my dyed ends. The curls just lay on each other and get muddled together so I don‚Äôt see any nice definition or volume throughout the day because of this and because my hair is just one solid color. 

My hair can withstand a lot. My previous ombr√© I did myself and I bleached it pretty light to be able to wear vibrant colors. My curls actually came out a bit more if I‚Äôm honest, and I wasn‚Äôt even doing CG back then! 

Anyways, my questions:

Should I bleach my hair (at a salon &amp; definitely not very blond. I‚Äôm looking for a caramel ombr√©) , or should I try to find a solution to my problem before I consider bleaching?

32461,2,6,4,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/gioa6f/lost_my_curl_over_the_years_can_i_get_it_back/,"Lost my curl over the years, can I get it back?**tl;dr** I had wavy hair in high school, went through 600 hair colours and cuts for a few years, and now there's no curl anymore.

Hi! I'm new to CGM. Growing up my hair was always very fine and pin-straight, but when I hit puberty everything changed. My hair expanded and became extremely massive, poofy and frizzy, without any curl to it. After a couple miserable years of feeling hideous (no one in my family had anything but straight hair) someone saw that my wet hair actually *was* curly and suggested I try scrunching gel in my hair to hold it. And DAMN, it was a game changer! All through high school I had wavy/curly hair that I loved. I didn't know much about haircare, so it probably wasn't the healthiest, but more days than not I had good hair days.

NaturallyCurly tells me my hair was Type 2B/2C, medium porosity, high density, and medium width.

After high school I played a lot with my hair. I probably had like 15 different colours, various cuts, and bleached it multiple times by myself. It damaged my hair, but I was never very concerned. My logic was that frying it off just meant I could cut it off and start again, fun! For the past couple years I have been rocking a pixie in my natural colour, too short to show curl.

Now, it's growing out and I want to keep growing it. But despite using my gel again, the curl has all but disappeared. It's just frizzy and mostly straight. I just learned about CGM (late, I know) and am researching products I can buy in Canada. Will CGM bring back some of my curls? Now that my hair is longer (and undyed!) I am missing my long waves from before, and I'm scared I screwed myself into them never coming back.

1. Jessicurl Gentle Lather shampoo
2. Kinky curly knot today to detangle, S2C and leave a little in. This is all done upside down.
3. I apply gel while still being upside down (sometimes mouse) and then plop for 15/20 mins. 
4. Air dry

My issues with my method:

1. Once I remove the plop and put my hair back, its all over the place. If I try to move strands around, I need to separate them. It also sticks in the back and looks ugly
2. Once it completely dries I SOTC but I don‚Äôt have complete curls so it‚Äôs not even curled all over
3. It takes like 2-3 hours to dry and I don‚Äôt have time to diffuse in the mornings before work (I have a 7mo old baby). I get migraines if I sleep with wet hair

Growing up I didn't learn to do curly hair because my mum has straight hair. I always had slightly wavy very knotty hair that wouldn't hold any styling. 

Then a year ago a hairdresser styled my hair using mousse which my scalp didn't like, so she suggested I rinse with apple cider vinegar to get the product out. 

I read up on it and it said everywhere it would make curly hair more curly as it clarifies any product build up but I ignored this because I thought my hair was straight.

http://imgur.com/gallery/DYXJfpd

My hair has been long pretty much my whole life and has always dried mostly straight with slight bends in the mid-lengths and upturns on the ends, unless I had just gotten out of the pool or the ocean because then it would be wavier. 

Beginning Dec 2018 (top left) was when I decided to try enhancing the wave by trying the CGM, using healthier products, and cutting off 6 inches of bleach fried hair. 

End of Jan 2019 (middle left) was when I started trying to find other products and a routine that worked for me because the I could already tell that the straight CGM wasn't going to work for me. My hair never looked worse and it was always so weighed down. Started trying the NYM Curl Talk line, Shea Moisture's Detox collection, and some leftover DevaCurl Wavy products from my best friend.

In May 2019 (bottom left) I was really beginning to doubt whether or not I'd ever be able to get my hair to have a tighter wave pattern. The products were fine, just not working the way I wanted them too and I didn't have patience lol. But I kept going because I'm stubborn, I was just miserable while I was doing it.

My best friend was trying to give me advice, but she has a mix of 3a, b and c curls on her head and didn't really know much about my 2a (2b on a good day) hair. My mom told me to quit trying because, and I quote, ""Your hair has been straight your entire life, and it will always *be* straight."" Keep in mind that she has been telling me my whole life  that when I was a baby up until I was like 1 yr old my hair was really curly after she would wash me. Great, thanks for your support mom, love you too.

ANYWAY, the pic on the right is of the best hair day I've had so far, I love my hair, this hair day has reinvigorated my soul, and I'm going to keep doing my thing. I still had trouble getting all the crunch out of my hair but it really doesn't matter right now because my hair looks amazing to me.

15896,1,2,5,7,/r/curlyhair/comments/atrd9x/consistently_decent_hair_for_months_looking_to/eh550jv/,"‚ÄúThe letters describe the width or diameter of the curls themselves. A = wide; B = medium; c = tight.‚Äù

(I would say B)

Type 1= straight
Type 2= wavy
Type 3= curly (I would say you are 3)
Type 4= coily/kinky

Here‚Äôs what it says 

‚ÄúHair type and curl pattern both describe the shape of your hair your hair naturally grows in. This shape or pattern of your curls is determined by the shape of your hair follicle. The more oval its shape, the curlier your hair will be! Heat, chemicals, damage, and even the weather can alter how your curl pattern presents itself, and other factors like pregnancy, certain medications, and health/diet changes can have a more permanent effect on your curl pattern.

Hair types are commonly broken down into four main groups (1, 2, 3, and 4), and each group further divided into three subcategories (a, b, and c.) The numbers describe the shape of your curls.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

Type 3:

Your hair is Type 3 if:
Your hair curls in the form of spirals or ringlets, ranging in width from the width of sidewalk chalk to the width of a straw. 
You struggle to control frizz and keep your curls defined throughout the day.
You often experience dry hair

So I would say based on this 3a-3b (your curl pattern looks tighter than ‚Äòwide‚Äô but less than ‚Äòtight‚Äô to me so u would say closer to 3b...

30963,6,2,5,7,/r/curlyhair/comments/cfb1dz/got_a_devacut_at_a_devachan_salon_and_it_was/,"Got a DevaCut at a DevaChan salon and it was horribleI have 2c waves to 3a curls depending on the day and how I style it. I‚Äôm not the curliest of curlies but still thought a DevaCut would help my hair.

I love near NYC so I booked a cut in at the DevaChan salon and was excited for a real deva cut. 

I went in and explained that I would like to keep my overall length but was ready for layers to give me top volume as my curls don‚Äôt start at the root and it gives me a triangle look. The girl was very nice and cut my hair dry and then passed me on to her assistant who then washed my hair and put product in it according to what my stylist said. 

Well, the girl didn‚Äôt put nearly enough gel in my hair, just put the other products in and then sat me under a big dryer. I sat for almost an hour until my hair was dry and then the original stylist came back and touched my hair. She said there wasn‚Äôt enough gel and that I was going to have to be re washed, styled, and dried. At this point I‚Äôve been there for 2 hours and I don‚Äôt have another 2 to spend there sitting under a dryer. So I politely declined and she said she was going to fix a few more pieces and then I could go. She lightly trimmed the bottom one more time and then sent me up to the front desk to pay my $160 for a glorified trim and not even styling my hair correctly.

Basically I‚Äôm just really upset.

This is my first time posting, so please let me know if I've done anything wrong with the pic link. Left photos are with my typical routine. Right photos were taken today (no products). Both routines will be in the comments.

My hair right now feels great -- soft, frizz-free, voluminous, the whole shebang. But it's also almost completely straight. If I don't load up the products, this is what my hair is. I guess it's a testament to the wonders of the CG method, but boy do I wish I could be a little less high-maintenance. I know my hair has a LOT more curly potential, because when I was a teenager I didn't do anything to it, and it was a solid 2C/3A without even trying. My hair's the healthiest it's ever been, so I'm just kind of at a loss.

Also: I feel as though I need less conditioner and more protein. I was hoping this SM yogurt and honey protein treatment would give me that, but I just feel intensely hydrated rather than that curly boost you get with protein. So I guess the next step would be a pure gelatin mask, as rice water didn't seem to do anything for me at all. Tips/tricks?

36151,7,6,5,1,/r/curlyhair/comments/bauw14/need_help_troubleshooting_cg_routine_3b3c/,"Need help troubleshooting CG routine (3b/3c)Hi everyone, I'm a first time poster but long time lurker. I have been doing CG for &gt;6 months now and have seen a wonderful difference in my hair! I used to flat iron my hair practically every day so I am thrilled that I can wear it down and curly now. But there are a few finicky parts of this process that I can't seem to figure out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My routine gives me great hair for the first several hours of day one. By the end of the day though my hair has formed a bunch of frizz at the top. I don't mind frizz and prefer a bit of volume but I find that especially at the top of my head it gets really fuzzy, dry, and loses definition. The bottom layers have more definition and curl pattern.  I have better success when I finger coil the top layer of my hair when I apply gel. But whether I finger coil or not by Day 2 the top part of my hair (from my root to about halfway down) is frizzy, dry and undefined. Refreshing with some water and gel helps a bit but not great. I usually refresh and style my hair in a low bun for day 2 because usually leaving it down is a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

My hair type is 3b/3c, shoulder length. My current routine is:

1. Wash with Tresemme Perfectly Undone conditioner every other day. About once a week I wash with Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Shampoo and condition with Tresemme.
2. S2C in the shower, plop with a cotton t-shirt while I dry off. I find that when I apply gel to totally wet hair it takes forever to air dry. 
3. Scrunch in a bunch of Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Gel. I've tried the Set Me Up Gel (more hold) but it leaves white streaks in my hair from the product. 
4. Air dry and then scrunch out the gel cast.
5.  I sleep with my hair up in a hair scrunchie and with my head on a silk pillow case.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried applying Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk before applying gel to help with moisture retention but when I do that I notice it helps with the frizz a bit but my hair doesn't seem to form a cast from the gel after drying and it looks a bit limp. I wash with conditioner so often because my hair looks super dry and won't last past day 2 (even then it's a stretch!).

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on how to keep my curls shiny, defined, less frizzy for longer than half a day? I know I should probably add something to my routine but I'm really not sure where to start and the order of operations.

Although I‚Äôm not really a coily/curly chick yet, I have been fascinated seeing my coils come to life!!

**the coils in the pic is when my hair is fully dry, with just my relaxed hair products**

Of all the youtube videos and reddit posts I have watched, i have not seen small coils like the ones I have. The coils in the picture are on my nape and the coils on my crown are looser.

I know I‚Äôm Type 4 with ALL of the hair textures (4a, 4b, and 4c). I have fine hair! With relaxed, my hair is low porosity..so i wonder how it‚Äôll be once fully natural.

My routine is still more geared to my relaxed hair as that‚Äôs the majority and it follows:
- CHI Royal Treatment Line

1) shampoo with their moisturizing shampoo
2) deep condition under a hooded dryer for 30 mins using their nourish intense masque
- detangle under running water after rinsing the masque out. 
3) add biosilk 17 leave in conditioner
4) add CHI Universe Macadamia &amp; Moringa Oil
5) Air Dry my hair

this will change as my hair grows out, but right now this is it!!

To fiddle you guys brains a bit, what type do you think my coils are in the picture?

First if all, I have fine hair, that apparently falls out like crazy after I had my kid (3.5 years ago....) My hair started to get a loose wave as I aged, and after pregnancy turned into 2B/2C/and 3A curls. Yeah, they are all over the place. 


I was getting regular layeres haircuts, but moved and found a deva cut specialist. I started going to her. My curls have been not so great ever since. But to complain really, I had an appointment set a couple weeks ago. My kid just started preschool, and brought home an illness, so I called them that morning to cancel because I was sick. I receive a text about an hour after my appointment time that they put me as a no show. So I called them. They say I have to pay a non refundable deposit to make another appointment because I didn't call within 48 hours (appointment was on a Monday, got the illness over the weekend). This wouldn't make me so mad if the last appointment I had scheduled, I show up, and the stylist isn't in. She was running errands. So she was a no show to my appointment, but whatever?


Anyway, I just made an appointment elsewhere, and am going back to just getting layers. The side of my hair that has layers is awesome. The back and other side have none or very long ones, and are just flat.


Anyone have recommendations for my hair type for any kinds of affordable products?  I can't use anything heavy. The deva line dosen't give me results worth the price. I think I have to wash my hair too. I have been using Kirkland moisture shampoo which I am kind of loving. And Whole Blends coconut water and aloe conditioner i saw another fine girl recommend. What can I use after? Thick gel gives me such buildup I would need to was at least every other day. Creams are too heavy.

As many others I guess my hair can be a mess. If left untstyled all on top is 2a. If properly styled it can be a 2b but underneath it‚Äôs 3b. So a biiig contrast. 

Now that I‚Äôve been fully following the curly method (for 2 weeks) I‚Äôm wondering if you have any recommendations on how I could style it or cut it?

It‚Äôs wierd because the under ones I‚Äôve realised are muuuch shorter, but I thought they were dry cut! :O (not curly cut). Should I get the upper layers dry-shorter than the lower ones? 
I worry if I do that they might curl more when shorter (because of less weight? Or maybe they can‚Äôt anyway) and end up being muuuch shorter than the ones underneath. 

I hope someone can help me üçÄ sorry for the long post I hope it makes sense üíôüíô


My curly routine:
- cowash tot herba (~horse tail, sage + humectants)
- same as above as conditioner
- leavein hairfood papaya (just a bit)
- gel Revlon scrunch (I need to find something stronger)
- Plopping + diffuser

- Once a week 2h hairfood papaya 
- Clarified twice so far, once green clay, once lemon

Hair type:
- low porosity (takes loong to dry)
- 0 elasticity
- high density
- thick
- oily scalp, dandruff, hair loss (but getting better I think!! üòä)


Unimportant for now: as per the technique I‚Äôm still trying small changes, not much difference. I always do STC and tried with more brush with it (better defined curls) or less (wider waves but clumped together), wetter hair (good results but I usually don‚Äôt have time for that) etc.

Just started, did I screw up or should I wait it out?So I did a reset wash two days ago with Nizoral shampoo and V05 sulfate/silicone free conditioner (did not cowash). Then yesterday I tried cowashing and conditioning with the V05. 

I normally have hair that‚Äôs mildly wavy, and it feels weirdly straight today? The ends have some wave to them but it‚Äôs pretty straight. I have layers so it basically looks like my hair is essentially straight until a certain point, where the shorter pieces have really no curl and the longer ones are just the ends.

My hair is also kind of separated around my part, maybe an oil issue? Like my hair isn‚Äôt as ‚Äútogether‚Äù? Dry conditioner helped (is that ok to use?)

I also brushed it in the shower both times and attempted to plop it after, though I‚Äôm still learning how to do that :)

It also feels lighter than normal which isn‚Äôt necessarily bad but sort of weird?

I was thinking low-poo might be good for me since my hair is just wavy (maybe 2A/2B ish?) and I‚Äôm prone to scalp issues, my scalp is super dry :( I think it‚Äôs dryness causing the dandruff. How often should I cowash vs shampoo? I have a sulfate and silicone free product to use for shampoo.

I am new to actually looking into and trying all the CG routine and advice, but I've been using a few CG friendly products just by chance on my own. To be honest I never really cared for my curls too much besides the fact that I just used some curly oriented products. I used to dye my hair electric blue and all the bleach really damaged the integrity of my hair. I got a new job and had to dye my hair back to my natural Brown right after I had double processed it and put baby blue in. The result left my hair so fried and I am trying desperately to repair it. It damaged my natural curl and wave so much. Typically if I have no dye in my hair I am a 2C/3A. I am now a combination of 2A/B and frizz most of the time with weird straight parts. I am very excited to try the beginner routine and basically dive wholeheartedly into the CG method, but I'm wondering if people might have an opinion about whether or not I should even attempt on my current hair or if I should just chop before starting a new hair care routine. This is what my hair looks like washed with a low poo shampoo, no conditioner, and air-dried. My scalp is actually quite oily typically but the ends of my hair appear so intensely dry compared to what it normally is because of the bleach damage. Is this type of damage repairable?

Routine:

Wash 3x per week with DevaCurl Low-Poo Delight

I've been doing the CGM for about 4 months now and I've gotten pretty far with it, it used to be pretty straight and frizzy and now it gets some curls, mostly waves (2b/c). I use function of beauty custom shampoo and conditioner (with curl definition), detangle in the shower and then scrunch in the shea moisture curl smoothie, I plop for about a half hour and then let my hair air-dry, sometimes I'll use the lush sea spray to give extra definition when my hair is dry. I find that the underside of my hair can get to a 2b or curlier but the top of my hair tends to fall flat. My hair also only stays curly for a couple days and then by the time I wash it again (1-2 times a week) it's completely straight. Any advice or product recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!

I'm reaching out to you guys expecting some mixed responses today. I started my natural hair journey a few months back ( I think it's been 3-4 months now). I've successfully done one of the two things - 

1. Realized that my hair is naturally boring and limp üò≠
Or
2. Used the wrong products (?)

Here's what happens - I have AMAZING wash days where my hair (2c/3a) shows some definition, some clumps, and holds the curls. The next day, it gets limp and the curls don't hold. But now, they're not really straight, they're not wavy or curly. It's just a giant mess that, although is manageable, isn't very pretty looking. 

I use:
1. Kerastase shampoo
2. Plum Olive and macadamia conditioner

I‚Äôm still experimenting with my routine:
Alternating Cantu co-wash and Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo - wash every 4 or 5 days
SM coconut and hibiscus conditioner
Add just a touch of SM coconut and hibiscus style milk
Use a t- shirt to scrunch then add gel and scrunch again. Planning to try to add the gel in the shower next time because waves didn‚Äôt clump. Very stringy.

Since you said your hair is damaged, you can try doing a repair mask and/or a deep conditioning treatment. My favorite is Shea Mositure Jamacian Black Castor Oil masque. It's full of protein and for $10 you get a pretty sizable tub. I would look at their line because they have a whole bunch of other ones. Make sure you check ingredients! 

My current routine is occasionally wash with Kinky Curly Come Clean Shampoo. This helps remove product build up.

Co wash with Suave essentials coconut 

S2C with Tresemme Botanique coconut conditioner 

Apply Perfect Hair Day leave in and LA Looks Sport Gel to wet hair

Then I use 3 t-shirts to remove as much water from my hair as possible

Plop for a while then air dry. When my hair is completely dry, I SOTC. 

The main focus is to keep your hair healthy. It may be helpful to get the damaged ends cut off and start fresh. I'm not a doctor, but maybe you can speak to one about a good diet and supplements if you think that could also help you hair grow long and healthy. For me, the CG method really helped grow out my hair. 

Good luck!

To precurse, I've gone natural with my hair about 3 years ago, from dyed black, straightened every single day pixie cut. I have 3a/3b low density curls, very fine, which is frustrating enough not having awesome volume like these cool instagram bitches. Recently chopped off all the dyed straightened damaged hair, so my hair is very short, like a grown out pixie (hubby and I like my hair short, so we have that going for us, I've always liked chopping all my hair off like once a year).. . So my curls look good, they're healthy ... He just doesn't like curly hair. While I appreciate that he doesn't lie, doesn't mean it didn't hurt my feelings that he doesn't like what naturally grows from my head, he doesn't prefer curls. He said he felt like an asshole for saying that, I know he felt bad and didn't mean to hurt my feelings. And he said that hair just isn't that important to him and he didn't marry my hair. Am I being overly sensitive?! Is anyone in the same position?? 
He's such a good husband to me, so I'm not looking for people saying ""lEaVe Ur mAn"" and I wouldnt have him any other way than honest. I guess I just need to not care that my husband doesn't like my hair?

28113,4,0,7,2,/r/curlyhair/comments/clsz3x/not_enough_protein_while_using_protein_products/,"Not enough protein while using protein products.Hi!  
I've been trying to follow the Curly Girl routine for a couple of years now. My hair wasn't extremely damaged ( i never used heat) but it was dry and undefined. Over the last couple of years I've seen way more definition, less frizz and more health. However: I've been having some problems in the last... six months? My hair loses definition fast, is not as voluminous as before and my 2c/3a curls are around a 2b now.   
Since this sounds like a need for protein, I did a stretch test and yep: 50% elasticity. I'm pretty sure I didn't have this a year ago.  
So, protein? But: two of the products I'm using have protein: my leave in and curl activator, which I alternate. Is this not enough? Or is there something else going on?  


My hair is also medium/low porosity so I'm afraid it's hard to fix. Also: medium density and medium thickness.

My current routine:  
Wash with Aunt Jackie Oh So Clean,   
condition with Yari Naturals Sulfate-Free Cream Conditioner (which turns out not to be entirely CG)  
Then either Yari Naturals Curl Activator Cream or Aunt Jackie's Quench! Moisture Intensive Leave-In Conditioner and then topping off with cheap cg proof mousse or gel. Always air dry.  


So, what I'd like to know:  
\- Is this a protein problem?  
\- how do I fix this?

25083,1,0,6,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/e9do1j/mod_announcement_a_few_changes/fb4vgjc/,"As someone who has championed the 'curl type doesn't matter' idea (see my flair) I'd really really appreciate it if you could explain what parts of the beginner routine you see as lacking (full disclosure I wrote the beginner routine long before I was a moderator for the sub. BTW this also means anyone is always welcome to contribute if you feel there's something missing from the wiki :) We're updating the wiki all the time!). Here's where I'm coming from:

* I'm white.
* My hair is fairly loose 2b-c ""curls"" with the occasional 3a spiral thrown in. Yet I use products made by and marketed exclusively for black hair, and I shop in the ethnic hair section. This experience made me reconsider my assumptions about what ingredients are meant for what hair. (While I love the brand, I'm disappointed Shea Moisture updated their marketing to cater to white women, and am frustrated at the extent to which people that look like the creators of the line have been cut out of recent marketing campaigns). Ingredients that I also thought would only work for loose curls like Eco styler gel is also frequently recommended by POC.
* I subscribe to both /r/naturalhair and /r/blackhair to expose myself to their advice and recommendations. From my reading there, I haven't seen substantially different tips from those we have here. In particular, porosity seems to matter much more than 'curl type': no matter where you fall on the spectrum, porosity seems to dictate how your hair responds to oils and butters and similar ingredients. Styling tips do of course vary a lot: and I'm still learning about the different styles available to kinky and coily hair types (just for my own education, not to give recommendations).
* The whole 'curl typing' system has [racist and sexist origins](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-black-people-came-to-believe-4c-was-a-bad-hair-texture-16265631) that makes me hesitant to use it even if it IS useful.

Ultimately, damage cannot be repaired, but you can make it look better. Protein will be the key here, it will temporarily fill in the holes in the surface of your hair, allowing your hair to retain moisture. [Homemade protein treatment.](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/p/recipes-and-projects.html) Easy, cheap, effective. Follow up with a deep conditioner. Use it whenever your hair seems limp, mushy or otherwise kind of sad. You'll need it more often than people without bleached hair.

You need more for styling than a mousse. That won't moisturize and won't help you hold curls together and prevent frizz. You need to leave conditioner in. A handful or two of it. (keep it off the top of your head if it will make you greasy or if it flattens out your volume). Put that in your hair and leave it there. I know this seems insane, but it works. (This doesn't need to be a special leave in conditioner, either. Get a big bottle of Tresemme Botanique, or two when they go on sale 2/$10.) 

You're not done yet. Put in the conditioner, then put in a ludicrous amount of gel. LA Looks Sports Gel (it's blue, it's cheap, it works) is my recommendation. Put in at least half a handful. You might need more. Then plop and air dry. Your hair will dry crunchy. You will be horrified. Put a few drops of oil on your hands (olive oil, coconut oil, jojoba, argan, whatever), rub them together, then scrunch out that crunch. Scrunch like you did putting in the gel. Gently rub your scalp to separate any crunchy roots.

I've been lurking here for awhile and seen some good tips, etc. My hair is pretty long now ( about 5 inches past shoulders) and I have run into a bit of an issue. My roots are like wavy/straight but then go into my natural 3B-3C hair. I got a trim a few days ago since I needed it and it did help them curl a bit more but it still isn't as curly as the rest of my hair. The trim gave me lots of volume instantly which is great as well. I am considering getting some short layers to hopefully help my roots. I have thin hair but alot of it, and was wondering if layers would look good on hair like mine.

 Right now, I use TGIN nourishing shampoo and conditioner, and air dry after scrunching DevaCurl‚Äôs Wavemaker. 
I‚Äôve tried using mousses like Shea Moisture‚Äôs curl mousse but it always made the hair underneath at my nape knot and become matted. I‚Äôve also tried to co-wash but every time I try, my hair feels oily and my scalp flakes and itches to no end. I‚Äôve tried using DevaCurl‚Äôs no-poo cleanser but my hair feels oily every time I‚Äôve used it. (I know you‚Äôre not supposed to comb it out in the shower, but if I don‚Äôt, my ends get super knotted and clumps just bunch at the ends and falls out.) I‚Äôve used nearly every curly hair brand under the sun, from Bumble + Bumble to Ouidad to Shea Moisture to Bounce Curl to DevaCurl, so maybe I‚Äôm just not doing something right. 
My hair is very mediterranean (Greek) and it‚Äôs completely virgin (no dye jobs, nothing), and I haven‚Äôt used heat on it in years. It takes a very long time to dry, and if I go to bed with wet hair, it will still be wet when I wake up. (Scents also tend to cling to it, not sure if that means anything. Like someone will be having a campfire miles away and my hair will smell like I was standing right next to it. It‚Äôs odd.) 
My curl patterns are just inconsistent at this point. I‚Äôd love to have ringlets all around my head, and the pictures are to show my hair and how inconsistent it can be. I guess I‚Äôm at a loss of what products to use, what to do with overall care, and what curl type it even is.

-Wash my roots every other day alternating between DevaCurl Low-Poo Delight and Maui Moisture Coconut Milk shampoo (the one in the blue bottle)
-Condition with DevaCurl One Condition Delight or Maui Moisture Coconut Milk conditioner (again, blue bottle). I switch between these brands for shampoo and conditioner (like alternating every wash day) because I like them both but too much protein from the Deva products makes my hair frizzy)
-Clarify once every week or two with a clarifying shampoo (currently using Bumble&amp;bumble Sunday shampoo but the Suave clarifying shampoo works great too), followed by a deep conditioner (Briogeo Don‚Äôt Despair Repair is my favorite). I know clarifying like that isn‚Äôt usually recommended around here but I‚Äôm so prone to buildup that it‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me from getting halo frizz and a funky feeling in my hair!

Conditioner: either Pink NYMN, Deva Curl One Condition, Anadlou Lavender and Biotin, or dark blue NYMN (but that‚Äôs not heavy enough so I usually just use it as a cowash)

I usually wash every 2 or 3 days and dc at least weekly. I Condition, rinse, and put my leave-in upside down then flip right side up for gel (usually brush it in between with a wet brush so it looks decent).

I just purchased the Shea moisture deep conditioning masque and I need some help with how to use it. I read through all the sidebar stuff and I know to use it with a shower cap and heat, but what I dont know is what to do after. Do I just cowash (I'm using tresseme botanique from the begginer list) and condition like normal right after using the deep treatment? 

Another question I have- After I apply product, I plop with a tshirt for 15 minutes, then I air dry. But my hair possesses the superpower of instant tangles, and one side gets really weird at the roots after plopping. Sometimes it sorts itself out while drying, other times I end up with hair going in all different directions after it dries and SOTC.  Do you arrange your hair at all after plopping? Or just take it down and don't touch it?

Two recipes both called for 1/4C of flaxseeds and both 2 and 2.5C of water. The batch I made yesterday was 1/4C flaxseeds and 2.5C water, but I only let it boil a couple of minutes after it started foaming; took it off of the heat, and only let it cool enough for me to handle it. Then transferred to a jar and popped it in the fridge. It looks much better today so maybe part of it not looking right was because it was still warm? I didn‚Äôt have any aloe or oils to add to it so it‚Äôs just plain flaxseed gel. 

The first two batches I attempted both had to be trashed because the pantyhose I was using burst open and seeds were everywhere! A couple and I would have just picked them out but this was most of them. Thankfully they‚Äôre not that expensive so I didn‚Äôt mind making a extra batches.

35190,0,7,6,3,/r/curlyhair/comments/fud6x3/need_a_gel_for_low_porosity_protein_and_glycerin/,"Need a gel for low porosity, protein AND glycerin sensitive hair with decent hold.. does this exist??Title says it. I am a 2c/3a curl type. Likely low porosity, as my hair gets easily weighed down by heavy products. I figured out about a year ago I am protein sensitive, and recently figured out my hair also does not react well with glycerin(atleast I think its glycerin or other humectants. Hair is fine after initial wash and dry, but my ends get progressively dryer/rough/frizzy through out the day.. its has been really dry where I live recently). I have my wash/condition routine down(routine at the bottom), but I am on the hunt for a decent gel with good hold that contains no: silicones, parabens, sulfates, or drying alcohols. I think I'd be ok with very small amounts of glycerin and/protein

I am also willing to pay top salon styler dollars for a gel that fits my needs, but would also be happy with a cheaper product.


Gels/stylers I have tried but didnt like:

Aussie instant freeze - made my scalp break out with cystic acne

Herbal essences totally twisted gel - works OK, but has a paraben and builds up over time, don't like the idea of letting something sit in my hair for a while that has parabens

Herbal essences totally twisted mousse - drying

KCCC - i love this stuff, except it does not have a good hold, looking for something that lasts more then 4 hours. I currently use this as a curl enhancer under my gel

Garnier curl scrunch gel - this is my current go to, but I do not like that is has silicones causes build up

Garnier clean gel - glycerin

Jessi curl styling gel - drying

Tresseme tres gel - drying

Goddess curls botanicle gelle - not a good hold

Devacurl ultra defining gel - was my HG until i figured out protein was not good for me 


Current routine:
Wash with devacurl build up buster once a week and follow with jessicurl deep conditioner

KCKT- cowash/conditioner/leave in (my HG!!)

KCCC- curl enhancer

31181,4,7,2,5,/r/curlyhair/comments/d0in91/sm_deep_conditioner_fd_my_hair_up/,"SM Deep Conditioner F'd My hair UP.Hello curlies!

    So I was being a good curlhead by deep conditioning my hair.  I tried a new DC by Shea moisture (Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen &amp; Restore Masque).  Oh my god my hair is R U I N E D.

My normally large clumpy curls became all stringy and frizzy, my hair was simultaneously wet and dry feeling at the same time, and my hair has been dull and dry ever since.  I have only been cowashing it with the CG friendly Botanique Tresseme conditioner and styling with Dippity do curly Gelee.

Lightening up your products should help a lot. Go to [Walgreens.com](https://Walgreens.com) and look for Giovanni 50/50. There is a shampoo and conditioner, they are both protein-free and have almost no oil and no butters. The shampoo should be cleansing enough to remove buildup in between clarifying, but it shouldn't be too drying. I use their Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner. They're almost exactly the same as the 50/50 line, just with a plant-based protein (soy).  VO5 has some really light weight rinse-out conditioners with small amounts of protein. Suave has some lighter options, too.

I use the Giovanni Direct Leave-in almost every day. It has no glycerin or protein, and is light on oil with no butters. I can co-wash with this if I don't need to remove a lot of product or grime. I can use it as a rinse-out or leave-in. I use it to refresh my hair by mixing a tiny amount in my hands with some warm water morning and night. Their Vitapro Fusion is basically a spray version of the Direct Leave-in and has been good so far. As I Am original leave-in is oil, glycerin and protein-free. It builds up pretty quickly. Kinky Curly Knot Today is another option, but I can't reapply this to refresh or my hair feels gross and it doesn't play well with a lot of other products. Eden Body Works Coconut Shea leave-in is nice in cold, dry weather. I use that one in the winter pretty often. It's light despite some oil and butter, has a little glycerin and a tiny amount of protein.

For gel, I like the LA Looks Nutra Curl (I can only find this at Walgreens online). It's protein and glycerin-free, but has a small amount of avocado oil. The Suave Max Hold gel is good. No glycerin or oils, a very small amount of silk protein. Aussie Instant Freeze has no protein or glycerin, but some jojoba oil, I believe. Giovanni has an LA Naturals gel with no glycerin, protein, or oils/butters. Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic. There are tons of gels out there. My hair likes cheap stuff, so that's what I stick with. For gels with glycerin, I like the As I Am Curling Jelly and the Cantu Define and Shine Custard.",2c,  land    opportunity     truly     haha    definitely    salvage    hair     mine    2c 3c

It's 2A/2B wavy, long, thick in density but fine. No heat damage or previous coloring or bleaching, so it's reasonably healthy. I cannot get it to look decent for the life of me. I started with the V05 clarifying wash and since then I've been using the basic beginner method on this sub - cowash with Tresseme Botanique, then add more (a lot more) for conditioning until it reaches slimy seaweed consistency and detangle with my fingers or a wide-tooth comb. The first issue happens when I go to rinse out any conditioner - it IMMEDIATELY re-tangles. I've tried adding back more conditioner as a leave-in and combing that smooth, but even soaking wet - like DRIPPING wet - the clumps look frizzy and weird. If I can get the clumps to look half-way decent, I add a large palmful of LA Looks Gel. I've tried praying hands and scrunching in from the bottom, and either way, the clumps go right back to looking frizzy and weird. I even tried adding water back to my hair, and the clumps smooth out a little, but the second I attempt to s2c, even if I use flat palms and gently lift the hair up to my scalp instead of squeezing, the clumps go frizzy again. I use a microfiber towel to very gently absorb excess water, then plop for about 10 minutes, but the second I take the plop off, the clumps start to break up into gross stringy sections of like 5 hairs each.

\- L'Oreal Evercurl to go with the Coconut and Hibiscus, or the Fruit Fusion Coconut Water to match the shampoo

&amp;#x200B;

Styling products:

\- LUSH Zeste hair gel, which tbh is probably expired by now but I just need to finish it.

Then I let everything air dry because I have no patience for styling tools or diffusers.

Tea tree oil seems to make it worse plus I find the Trader Joe‚Äôs tea tree tingle shampoo drying. None of the dandruff shampoos seem to help. My scalp seems to develop build up easily and no matter how much I use my finger pads and a scalp brush, it doesn‚Äôt seem to help.

I do it in the shower but I do try to squish out any excess water with my hands first. But it‚Äôs still pretty sopping wet. I have 2a,2b,3a hair depending on everything (weather and protein etc.). I also make sure to do a generalized zigzagging parting first unless I am going for the Medusa look of hair sticking out weirdly. I scrunch up sections of hair into a tee shirt to hand dry a bit before plopping. But I don‚Äôt do the same section more than once, I just try to really squeeze as hard as I can each section once it is next to my scalp. Then I use a new tee shirt to plop for 20-30 mins usually 30 is best.. more than 30 doesn‚Äôt seem to help any in my hair and I done want to leave my scalp wet for too long.

Btw, the first 5 times I plopped I hated it and gave up for a few months but I didn‚Äôt make a parting first (parting sort of disappears into the plop but I think the gel or curl cream remembers) and the second thing I did wrong (for me - others have good luck with it) was to plop overnight or for half the day.

a few years ago before i found out about the curly hair community i was perfectly content with my hair. i knew the curly girl method tho, i and i stopped straightening my hair to try it because i used to have to straighten my hair multiple times a day (no joke). my hair obviously had some sort of texture which is why i decided to try the method.

it worked really well and my hair which was before just a blob of frizz became very wavy/curly. i remember my relatives saying stuff about how curly it was and i felt really good.

until i saw people online pushing the curl chart. so i looked it up, and my hair is 2c with 3a pieces in the front and on the ends. it didnt bother me at first because theres nothing to be bothered about. wavy hair is beautiful. i just dont have wavy hair. but according to this chart, i do. im fine with it until i read comments saying stuff like ""now THIS is 2c/3a hair, (insert rude remark about other people being dumb)"". 

anyone who sees my hair would say its curly, but if you look at some of these charts, it even says my hair is like 2a or 2b in some of them. why are these charts so inaccurate? and how can my hair be visibly curly yet its supposedly 2c? its all so confusing",2c,  people    mean    curl    types     becoming    insecurei    see    rudeness    youtube    instagram    comments    curl    types     people    passive    aggressive    hair    curly    enough     really    curly     etc    annoying     years    ago    found    curly    hair    community    perfectly    content    hair     knew    curly    girl    method    tho     stopped    straightening    hair    try    used    straighten    hair    multiple    times    day     no    joke      hair    obviously    sort    texture    decided    try    method     worked    really    well    hair    blob    frizz    became    wavy curly     remember    relatives    saying    stuff    curly    felt    really    good     saw    people    online    pushing    curl    chart     looked    up     hair    2c    3a    pieces    front    ends     didnt    bother    first    theres    nothing    bothered    about     wavy    hair    beautiful     dont    wavy    hair     according    chart     do     im    fine    read    comments    saying    stuff    like     now    2c 3a    hair      insert    rude    remark    people    dumb       anyone    sees    hair    would    say    curly     look    charts     even    says    hair    like    2a    2b    them     charts    inaccurate     hair    visibly    curly    yet    supposedly    2c     confusing  ,people mean curl type becoming insecurei see rudeness youtube instagram comment curl type people passive aggressive hair curly enough really curly etc annoying year ago found curly hair community perfectly content hair knew curly girl method tho stopped straightening hair try used straighten hair multiple time day no joke hair obviously sort texture decided try method worked really well hair blob frizz became wavy curly remember relative saying stuff curly felt really good saw people online pushing curl chart looked up hair 2c 3a piece front end didnt bother first there nothing bothered about wavy hair beautiful dont wavy hair according chart do im fine read comment saying stuff like now 2c 3a hair insert rude remark people dumb anyone see hair would say curly look chart even say hair like 2a 2b them chart inaccurate hair visibly curly yet supposedly 2c confusing,people mean curl type becoming insecurei see rudeness youtube instagram comment curl type people passive aggressive hair curly enough really curly etc annoying year ago found curly hair community perfectly content hair knew curly girl method tho stopped straightening hair try used straighten hair multiple time day joke hair obviously sort texture decided try method worked really well hair blob frizz became wavy curly remember relative saying stuff curly felt really good saw people online pushing curl chart looked hair 2c 3a piece front end didnt bother first nothing bothered wavy hair beautiful dont wavy hair according chart im fine read comment saying stuff like 2c 3a hair insert rude remark people dumb anyone see hair would say curly look chart even say hair like 2a 2b chart inaccurate hair visibly curly yet supposedly 2c confusing,Advice for Textured Hair,Cutting/Growing,Daily Routines,Styling/Volume
