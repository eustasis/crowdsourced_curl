I shampoo with tresemme botanique(the sulfate-free solution) usually, but use V05 clarifying shampoo when I feel like I have some build-up. I rinse it out normally. I then apply about a half-dollar amount of NYM royal honey and desert melon(I do all of this rightside up), and brush through my hair with a wide-tooth comb. I leave the conditioner in for around 5-10 minutes, then rinse it out rightside up. I get out of the shower and flip my hair upside down and scrunch out excess water and form curls with a cotton t shirt. Then, I add a dime-sized amount of As I Am Leave-In and then maybe a quarter-sized amount of Kinky Curly Curling Custard. I apply these through scrunching.

My hair takes around 3-4 hours to fully dry, and it holds so much moisture and gets so heavy that my curls get pulled out over and over again. I have to continually scrunch out water and reform the curls because they completely fall out around every 5 minutes. Once my hair is nearly dry, it holds the curl just fine and I just sit and wait for it to air-dry. Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? I don't know why my curls fall out repeatedly whenever they're wet. If I just get them dry then they're perfect.


My routine is pretty simple but I'm definitely going to add a hard-hold gel or mousse in the future. My hair is so fine that the curls just fall out gradually if not being held in place. Anyone have suggestions on how to improve my hair""s ability to maintain a curl/any hard-hold product suggestions?


I consider my hair 2c/3a, very thick, but very fine in texture.


Cutting off a lot of the length certainly helped the curls form, but I am excited to continue growing it out and see how my hair responds.",2c

I’ve been using the same deep conditioner (Mielle Bassu and Mint Deep conditioner) for most of the last year.

My hair loves protein and is very prone to frizz. 

I think LUS is a really great product/system, but it's not the best product for me personally. There's a lot of polyquats in the conditioner and the leave-ins - for me, this meant great results when I first started using it, but eventually turned into build-up and stringyness that I would dry my hair out trying to shampoo out. I want to emphasize that this won't happen to everyone, because everyone's hair is different. 

The products are great value for money - a very little bit goes a long way. In 8 months I think I used maybe two sets of their three-step system, probably less of the shampoo. 

The all-in-one is an excellent refresh product when mixed with water. 

The company has fantastic customer support, seem like good corporate values/ethics, etc.

I discovered the whole journey, the products everything and I am desperately trying and it's not really working, or not as well as I hoped. There is a hit of an evolution but it's hard for me to see.

I think I'm a 2A-2C but I'm seeing some 3A in there as well when my hair just dried. So I co-wash once a week, deep condition once a week as well (shea moisture deep conditioner), use a leave in (lush rnb) and use a gel (eco styler) for hold. I apply my styling products right after washing and blotting (I blot my hair with a t-shirt) scrunch all the products in, plop it and leave it to air dry, once a month I clarify. I don't really know what to do when my hair is dry for frizz or to refresh them, i wet them a little and put more leave in and gel and it looks okayish but it's still very frizzy. When my curls/waves have a weird shape i'm at a loss. Like a lot of my locks lost their shape and the back of my head of hair is pretty much straight, same for the curls underneath, a lot of the curls are straightened out. Sometimes they come to life but it's barely there. Anyway, So on washing day after it dried my hair looks good, not perfect but really nice, low frizz, nice curl pattern... And then I wake up the next day and they start falling apart again and it just gets worse as the week goes. I don't know what I am doing wrong, any experienced curly girls with tips are very welcome because I am desperate, I honestly about to give up and cry :(

Oh and just fiy before I started my journey all I used was shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner and my curls were gone. I found co-washing helps my oily scalp, it barely gets greasy anymore, i have no scalp itchiness anymore and most of my dandruff is gone so I think my hair is just very very dry.",2a

for context, i had very straight hair as a kid naturally, and then around puberty it became frizzy all of a sudden and slightly wavy, like 1b. 

however, i was really bad at taking care of it! i would brush it violently, used elastic hairbands pulled super tight. since i hated the frizz, i got into the habit of straightening my hair daily, without any heat protectant, sometimes applied even on wet hair. i wasn't big on the conditioner, and that which i did use probably had silicones iirc. 

the frizz (and breakage!) got bad enough that i cut off all my hair at 15 y/o and have kept it that way for the last 7 years. i briefly grew it out to be chin-length around 18 but i got that frizz again and cut it off within 6 months of finally growing it out. 

i only recently realized that sometimes excessive frizz on straight hair is indicative of underlying texture. my short hair right now doesn't give me frizz issues and falls mostly straight. i've had some indication my hair may be wavier than i thought (like 2a, 2b?), due to how it looked when it was air-drying out of the shower before i started all that ironing nonsense.. but maybe that was just humidity playing it up. 

my dad's side (which i've gone on more) has super straight hair, 1a-1b, my mom's side has 2b-2c hair... my brother had straight hair in childhood and 2b after puberty too, so it's not out of the question that my hair texture changed slightly. but i'm concerned i'm reading too much into it and will spend a lot of money on products for wavy hair that won't really help me. plus, i don't want to grow out my hair again until i know how to prevent all that frizz. 

i need people more learned than i to assess if i do have wavy hair, and any tips on how to take care of it would be HIGHLY appreciated, esp cheaper products to start with. 

pics below... i still don't condition all that much bc i never know which conditioners have silicone and short hair doesn't need all that as much don't kill me aha

About a week and a half ago I finally had a pretty good curl day, and I'm excited that today was even better I think!

I tried some new products today which I like a lot so far.

Here's the scoop:

My hair: Fine, low-porosity (I think? Or at least, it takes a while to get wet and even longer to dry and heavy ingredients are terrible), 2a and 2b 

* Wash with Inahsi Naturals Soothing Mint Sulfate-free Gentle Cleansing Shampoo
* Apply Inahsi Naturals Mango Hemp Restorative Hair Masque for about 10 minutes, squished into hair 
* S2C Inahsi Naturals Soothing Mint Moisturizing Conditioner, since almost all the way out
* Scruch in a very small amount of Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-in Conditioner
* Scrunch in small amount of Coconut Avocado Curl Defining Custard
* Scrunch in Not Your Mother's Naturals Blue Sea Kale &amp; Coconut Water Weightless Mousse (quite a lot)
* Scrunch in Bioterra Alcohol-free Defining Gel 

Then: 

* Plop for about 40 minutes (though I may need to change this, it made some funky curls)
* Diffuse about 3/4 dry
* Apply more mousse Smasters-style
* Diffuse the rest of the way (my hair takes FOREVER to dry with any amount of gel)
* Wait for about 30 minutes
* Scrunch out the crunch with a VERY fine layer of Shea Moisture Baobab Oil on my hands

Now if I can only figure out the mystery that is Day 2 hair... Haha :)",2a

I’m a 2B/2C with some 3A curls and I’m wanting to get a haircut (it’s been almost 7 months since my last one, which was a trim). I’m on the fence as to whether or not I want to get a devacut or just a regular cut from a salon whose stylists work well with a bunch of textures.  

Main Question: Does wet cutting destroy curl clumps?

I want to ask for layers to help with removing some weight that’s flattening my roots. 

And follow-up question, to those who have gotten a devacut or a standard wet cut, what differences in your hair (or lack) have you noticed? Do you prefer one over the other?

I'm desperate.I was so happy when my friend showed me this subreddit. No one else in my family has curly hair, so I never really knew how to take care of it properly; I thought you just shampooed and conditioned it in the same way you would straight hair. I didn't know about casting or plopping or even just the benefits of using a leave in conditioner.

That initial bliss is somewhat gone now...

Recently my hair has been extremely dry and frizzy and unmanageable, even more than it was before I changed my haircare routine to be more curly hair friendly.
Even just brushing it in the mornings has been such a painful experience because it's knotting much more than usual. Another thing that scares me is while writing this I can feel that my scalp has kind of a dull pain, probably from the abuse it goes through in the morning while I brush it.
And my hair is no longer soft, it feels like straw (and I NEVER used to have that issue). It was so bad that I had to resort to using a coconut oil and egg hair mask, which, I know is good for my hair and I should be doing, but the fact it had to use it as a last resort scares me.

I am so scared for the health of my hair right now. Even after the hair mask it still feels... wrong. It still has that straw-like texture.

Here is my full hair routine; I tried to leave nothing out:

I brush my hair before I shower in the morning (I do brush it dry because I heard when you brush it wet your hair tends to break off easier?).
I use a comb, not a brush.
When I shower I will only shampoo when I feel I need to; I don't really have a set schedule. I don't go by if my hair feels oily, I always go by my scalp itself.
I don't shampoo more than twice in a week. But I use conditioner everyday.
I also use a leave in conditioner and gel on the days I know I'm going out (at least 5 times a week).
I try to plop most mornings, but some I really just don't have the time, so I just apply the leave-in conditioner and gel and try to add volume using my hands.
And that's pretty much where it ends. I do everything for my hair in the morning.

Should I be doing more at night? Am I suffocating my hair with all of the products I'm using? Am I supposed to be rinsing them out at the end of the day?

Another question I've always had is (but I feel like I see no one mention in their routines), do most of you shower at night or in the morning? I figured morning was better to get your hair wet and primed, but after my recent experiences, I'm wondering if showering at night is better for rinsing out all of those products.

Just more information that may be useful:

I'm not sure if this is helpful for just hair health advice, but I believe I am  between 2C/3A.

And, although I don't believe my products are the issue themselves but probably how I am using them, they are:

• Maui Moistures Shampoo and Conditioner: Vanilla Bean for Frizzy, Unruly Hair

• Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave-In Conditioner

• Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Defining Lotion

I have followed the CG method or a slightly modified version of it for years. I feel like this has been the best thing for my hair.

My method for the past few years: I wash my hair every 3-4 days, about twice a week. Midweek, I cowash with my conditioner. On the weekend, I use a sulfate-free shampoo with my conditioner and follow up with a deep conditioner. I finger detangle while I have conditioner in my hair. After washing my hair,  I use a leave-in quite literally and follow up with a hair cream and oil applied in sections. Essentially, the LCO method. Recently, I find that I have to finger coil my hair otherwise it'll dry super stringy. It's tedious by my hair looks nicely defined afterwards. In the summer, I air dry. In the winter or when I am in a rush, I will diffuse. For day 2, day 3, and on rare occurrence day 4 hair, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair just slightly and use a bit of leave-in and oil on any frizzy bits. At night, I sleep with a bonnet. My hair is too short for pineapple method but when it was longer I did that.

I currently live in Asia but this method has worked for me both here and back in the US. Although, I have to clarify my hair a bit more know due to air and water quality issues. On both continents, I was living (am living) in places with hot and humid summers but my hair cooperates. 

For products, right now I am trying my hand on readily available products as to avoid paying overseas shipping so it is Aromatica for Shampoo and Conditioner, and L'Oreal Botanicals and Yves Rocher for styling products. They are okay but I definitely am missing my DevaCurl.

Whether you use the CG method or not ultimately depends on you and your hair. Again, I love the CG method but I have seen some Curlies who don't use it and their hair has flourished as well.

22325,/r/curlyhair/comments/gb22b4/it_takes_ten_years_for_my_hair_to_dry/fp38rej/,"Hey! It might take ten years to read this comment! tl;dr: microfiber towel scrunching, don't plop too long, try to let your gel form a cast before bed and sleep with some airflow around your hair (more below). 

 It sounds like we have similar hair - curly, thick/dense, and not fine (my hair isn't coarse but it's not fine, either). Basically lots and lots of high porosity hair to soak up water and products. My hair is a mix of spirals and corkscrews with some waves - basically 3a with bits of 2c and 3b in terms of curl patterns. My hair takes ages to dry with product in or when bound up somehow, but if I jump in a pool on a warm day and don't shower after it will dry fast as anything after that, with all the water soluble product rinsed off and nothing else to keep moisture in. 

Over the years I've found that my best options for drying my hair that don't involve shoulder strain are: 
* Microfiber towel/turbie twist 
- don't plop for too long 
- root clip for a while before bed 
- sleep with hair up in some way that it can still move a bit (satin scarf, silk bonnet, etc).

So basically my best washes come in the evening. After cleansing and conditioning I usually: 

-rake/comb through a curl cream
-scrunch gently with bare hands to encourage clumping
-prayer hands gel over all 
-scrunch gently but thoroughly with a microfiber towel making sure that the towel is really soaked 
-scrunch in a bit more gel with my bare hands 
- plop in a different microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes (basically time to finish skincare, dry off, moisturize, and put on clean pyjamas)
- remove plop and root clip *or* just make sure to flip my hair from side to side occasionally if I don't want to be bothered with clips
- do something else for an hour or so until I go to bed 
- put my hair up either a) in a pineapple and sleep on a silk pillowcase, b)wrap up in a satin scarf so the hair is loosely piled on my head or c) plop into a loose-fitting sill bonnet, again so my hair is loosely piled on my head 
- sleep
- take down my hair in the morning and SOTC and fluff as the absolute last thing I do before starting my day. Sometimes I don't SOTC until I get to work, because my hair may still be a bit damp at the roots, but it's better than wet or heat-damaged hair, for me. 

If I don't have an overnight available, I'll do these steps but instead of sleeping I'll diffuse for a little while on low heat, high speed - I have both a bowl diffuser and a hand-shaped Devafuser. 20 minutes will get through most of it. 

I find scrunching with microfiber gets me much better curls than even the softest jersey, and it makes drying or mostly drying an actual possiblity. This routine might  seem fussy but most of it is passive time and it's not overly picky about products or specific techniques (my root clipping is haphazard, I don't do bowl methods or extensive pulsing or finger coiling etc.). 

Good luck!! I absolutely hate having wet hair, especially in the summertime when it's just like wearing a wet wool sock on your head! 😁

Wash days I use the shampoo and conditioner. I just ran out of Ogx Argon oil curl cream but I use to mix that with the curl custard. Stand in the shower with hair soaked and squish with the curl cream and Moptop. I was doing this with my head flipped over but now I'm trying it to the side in an attempt to keep larger curl clumps. Flipping my head over makes my curls very stringy. I use a cotton tee shirt to dry and plop then air dry. My hair is very frizzy and dry and is often sticky. 


Refresh isn't really great at this early stage. I have to saturate my hair every morning and I apply the curl custard. If its day two it three I either just wet the custard that is in my hair from day 1 or use just a tiny bit as a ""refresh""

19502,/r/curlyhair/comments/gf67fx/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/fqbtks9/,"Hi! So a couple of things (and I have no idea what your routine is, so just bare with me here) I thought reading through your comment:

* “More uniform” waves/curls will most likely happen with more clumping of the curls. To achieve this effect better without having to add more products (ie gel or curl cream or whatever), after shampooing, flip your head upside down in the shower and take a crap-ton of conditioner through your hair until everything feels slick and detangled. Wrap it up in a bun on the top of your head (makeshift, without a tie or anything, just to get it out of your way and let the conditioner further absorb) and continue showering. When you are done with everything else, flip your head upside down again (I point the shower head pretty much straight down at this part so my face isn’t streaming with water), and take cupfuls of water with your hands to squish out the conditioner until it feels like a silky, watery mixture (experiment it’s the feeling here—everyone is different and their hair needs different amounts of conditioner). Stop the shower and squish excess water out with you hands while still upside down. Here, you can choose to plop, add gel/curl cream in, and then scrunch out excess moisture with a tee shirt and diffuse or scrunch out excess moisture with a tee shirt and air dry. You’ll notice that your curls will clump together more with more definition when they have conditioner holding them together. It sounds like a lot to add, but it really only adds maybe a minute to your routine in total, once you get the hang of it.

* The next thing I thought was that you should try to go further with the CGM. I had [2A waves](https://imgur.com/a/jEHBa) when I began. Now, on a bad day, my hair is [2C-ish](https://imgur.com/a/3LbtBhG) (today) and on a good day, it’s a mix of 2C/3A. Unfortunately, I don’t have any good day pictures right now because DevaCurl products kind of ruined my hair, but I’m working on getting that back.

* As for beach waves, maybe when you do all the conditioning steps and everything, at the end, just kind of take your fingers through your waves and then let them set like that? I’m not sure there. I’ve also heard of salt sprays, but I’m skeptical of those because salt can be very drying and curly/wavy hair tends to be very dry already.",3a

My scalp is extremely sensitive since I spent my entire life with my hair in tight braids for school or a ponytail since anything else was ""vain"".

I’ll try to go into as much detail as possible about my hair routine. 

As soon as I get out of the shower, I flip my hair upside down and scrunch it with a cotton T-shirt. I take one full pump of the Oliology Coconut Oil Curl Cream and scrunch it into my hair, then comb it through with a wide-tooth comb. Then I take the mousse, dispense a cream-puff sized amount onto the back of my hand, rake it through a section of my hair, and scrunch the section, and I do that around my whole head. The mousse dries, creates a cast, and I wait until my hair is fully dry before I take a hair pik and fluff out my hair until my hair isn’t crunchy anymore. 

The problem arises after I fluff out my hair. My hair feels limp, dry, and it looks stringy. It curls a little bit, but not the way I know my hair can curl. it seems like my hair just clumps together. Not like the cute curl clumps. I wish I would’ve taken a picture earlier today so I can truly describe what I’m talking about. Anyways, I have to mist my hair with a spray bottle, fingercomb it through, scrunch it again, and wait until it dries and I fluff out my hair with a hair pik AGAIN for my hair to actually curl how I want it to and how I know it can curl. I feel like this is an extra unnecessary step that can be eliminated if I fix whatever i’m doing wrong in my hair routine, but I guess I can live with wetting and scrunching my hair twice. It’s not like I’m seeing anyone anytime soon anyways. 

So, from all of that, does anyone know what i’m doing wrong the first time around and how I can fix it? Any cooperation would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions that I didn’t include in this, let me know. Thank you everybody &lt;3",2b

I'm currently 23 and around this time last year my hair slowly started to change to a very odd, frizzy, unnaturally kinked/coarse mess. It started with one small section near my right temple and slowly became the whole crown of my head by last May and in July I lost all of the curl pattern on the top half of my hair. It's not straight at all and its not curly. Its just a coarse mess that looks extremely frizzy.

Recently I've switched my hair care products and started only shampooing my hair once a week and co-washing it 1-2 times in between shampoo and which hasn't helped either (both products are from the master list of products from this sub). The portion of my hair that still curls is responding great to this but not the top half.

A month ago I got my hair cut thinking that it was because my hair was too long and was weighing it down so I took off about 2 inches and got long layers back, and unfortunately this only took off the portion that was still curling normally and left me with more kinked/coarse hair than curl.

My mom is convinced it's hormonal and my hair is changing texture because of this, but since I'm 23 I disagree with her as this would've happened when I was 13 and going through puberty.

Recently (today, rather) I had remembered that when I was 18 and thought it was a good idea to make my hair lighter with (very) diluted hydrogen peroxide in the summer but my hair wasn't damaged after that, instead it just looked like a weird blonde. All of that has grown out now but it had me thinking that I possibly damaged the hair follicle when I did that, causing this weird mess that I have now.

I'm really hoping that its just dry and damaged because I loved my curly hair (and straightened it at most maybe once a month or for a few holidays), so if anyone has any suggestions or ideas as to whats happened with my hair it'd be SO appreciated because I miss my curls :(

- Natural 2a &amp; 2b in the back, 2c &amp; 3a in the front. Bottom layer has traditionally been a 1c or 2a. Responds well to LA Looks Sports Gel and becomes more of a 2a/2b

- Mid back length. I got layers a while back but not from a curly stylist (*cries*)

- Medium-High(ish) porosity? My hair dries in like an hour and a half if I just leave it alone. It also really seems to not mind protein all that much. 

- fine/medium diameter, sparse distribution (I can see my scalp pretty easy)

- I did deep condition my hair recently which over-moisturized it (but I shampooed it with a strongish sulfate (mentioned above) to counteract this and it seemed to work) 

- I’ve been using Neutral Protein Filler and scrunching it into my hair every now and then. Doesn’t seem to do a lot? It doesn’t make my hair hard or easily broken or much of anything to be honest. 

- May have been curlier/clumped at the top as a young teenager, but I developed PCOS and a lot of it fell out. Also, I take birth control pills now. At that point in my life, I only had access to shampoo, no conditioner. 

- Half Vietnamese, half (white) American. My dad had/has 3b curls and my mom (and grandparents) has some barely-there 1c/2a waves. I got literally everything in between 1c and 3b lol

I started using the CG method a few years ago, and I achieved some super cute, pixie-length curls. The volume and definition was, in a word, divine. Loved it, very happy.

Recently, I decide I miss my long hippie-hair, after several years of pixie-cuts. Growing out a really short hair style is an awkward process, as many of you may know. So I brace myself for a couple months of bad hair days. I'm prepared to execute an array of hobby pins, scarves and hair clips as needed.
 What I'm not prepared for is that my hair just... Isn't curling suddenly. Its still shirt, but long enough to tuck behind my ears. But she won't curl up captain. She's drying out a wavy 2a, at best. Neither gel, mousse or any other tricks are helping. Plopping leaves me with some voluminous helmet hair, but no spirals. Gently scrunching it with product? Nothing.

I haven't changed my routine. I use a low-sulfate shampoo once a week, a plain coconut Suave conditioner, and a lightweight leave-in, maybe some LA looks gel when I'm feeling extra. Air-dry because  I'm too lazy to diffuse.

So I have 3b/3c hair and I don’t know what to do with it. I don’t have heat damage as I hardly use heat and the last time I even used heat was 3 years ago. Despite this, my hair is always frizzy and my curls never look defined. As well as this, my hair never grows and has been the same length for the past 4 years. My hair never ‘goes down’ to my shoulder and always faces ‘upwards’ if that makes sense.
I starting to really hate my hair and have a strong urge to straighten it. It would make my life so much easier. 
My current routine is:
I wash my hair once a week with Shea Moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo and I sometimes wash my hair with a dandruff shampoo due to my dry scalp. My hair is always itchy. I then use the Maui moisture curl quench and coconut conditioner and follow that with Shea moisture super fruit complex 10 in 1 masque to deep condition my hair.
After I wash my hair, I put on Shea moisture Jamaican castor oil leave-in conditioner followed with the Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie and its gel. I sometimes use jojoba oil along side it.
I am allergic to coconut oil and I find that all these products just sit on my hair and it never gets absorbed.
Even have I air dry my hair, my curls are not defined. I just look like a frizzy mess. 

I would appreciate any advice!

I've been slowly making the switch to the CG method, I think this is where it turns into a discouraging vent:
My hair is long and just doesn't curl very well, and to be honest I just don't want to spend my life around my hair to only end up with this result. Don't get me wrong im super pleased with how my hair is now, I like that I can actually leave the house with it natural, but the insane amount of time and money spent to only get a little wavy, and still have so many issues, is just sooooo discouraging. I don't want to completely give up on the CG method, but I do need some help finding some European brands to try. I'm from California but living in Greece for the summer, so any Greek wavies help me out? I'm running low on pretty much everything and I don't know if I should give up CG or hunt for products 

I (think) I'm a 2B on top, and there is about an inch all around my hairline that is 2A and just does not want to wave, it's just lifeless.

Routine: 
Wash almost everyday- on days I go wavy I can only do 2nd day hair in a pony or a bun, because no matter what it's a knotted shit show in the morning. I also *try* to work out every day and I sweat so much that there is just no way I'm not washing it.

Shampoo and condition: Shea Moisture Fruit Fusion- I like that my hair feels pretty soft after and detangles easily

All of my styling products I put on pretty wet hair, I section the top from the bottom, and comb everything through to evenly distribute it, and then scrunch everything with a microfiber, sometimes I plop sometimes I dont.

Devacurl Decadence Leave-In- not bad, again I like that it detangles easily but not the biggest fan of Devacurl looking to ditch this when its empty

Cantu Curl Activator- I *almost* gave up CG until I found this. I love the way it feels in my hair, I get nice waves, much more controlled frizz and my hair still feels soft and ""touchable"" 

Devacurl Arc Angel- I like it, I like that it doesnt get flakey on me 

I usually just air dry it, I have a diffuser but i haven't seen anything noticeable in the way it looks so I usually go the lazy route.

New to CGM and have some questions.I have had an ongoing battle with my frizzy wavy 2a/2b with some 2c strands since as long as I can remember. I was washing with sulfates and whatever I could pick up that was cheap and straightening my hair so I didn't have to deal with my waves in the all year round humid weather where I live. Only about two years and a half ago did I discover that I needed to stop using sulfates. I stopped that altogether and started using devacurl products, when those got too expensive I moved on to others like all about curls and shea moisture.

So here are my issues. I need to incorporate a purple shampoo into my routine and my hair is currently feeling like straw which leads me to believe I have protein overload from using so many hydrating and high protein products. At first I thought the straw like and frizzy feel was due to the hair bleaching, but my hairdresser says it is likely protein overload. So my questions are:

how do I incorporate the purple shampoo into my routine? Do I just use it when I shampoo once a week and cowash with my conditioner on the other days?

How do people regulate their protein levels? Do you just have different lines of products in your cabinet, like one line for when you need protein and another for when you have protein overload? It seems like that's what I need because of how sensitive my hair is to protein levels

When I looked into protein overload, people say to use a deep conditioner. Well, I have one in my cabinet, it's the devacurl deep sea repair l, but I now have been told that it is all protein. So how do I know which deep conditioners have protein and which do not when they are all deep conditioners?


For now I am planning on buying a clarifying shampoo and switching to moisturizing only products like the not your mothers Tahitian gardinia as that was what was recommended to me. Does anyone know what else I can do for protein overload?",2a

That Shea Moisture Curl and Shine conditioner was WAY too heavy for my 2b hair. I used it twice and it left my hair heavy, frizzy, and limp. I would replace it ASAP.  

You should do another wash with the V05 to clarify that Shea Moisture our of your hair, then stash that bottle in the back of the cabinet and change to the co-wash or sulfate-free shampoo. Some people use a combination of co-washing some days and using a sulfate-free shampoo other days.  ",2b

I never use hair mask or natural remedies, i use head &amp; shoulders shampoo cause it’s the only thing that gets rid of the oil &amp; dandruff, even though the next day my hair is soaked in oil. I don’t use conditioner either.

So what i’m saying, those sulfate stuff is the only things that work to stop my hair from getting oily, i don’t know what other products to buy, mind you i can’t buy anything expensive or let it go to waste; money’s very tight.

I have recently started caring for my wavy/curly hair and have a few questions. 

[ps. I live in a country where salons &amp; products catered for curly hair are non-existent / limited :( ]

My hair has many curl patterns that flows to my chest. The curls usually start at the midsection, so my roots to the midsection are straight and flat. 

The bottom layers, too, are basically straight/2a hair.

My top layers ranges from 2b-3a curl types (again starting from the midsection)


So my questions are:

1- tips for volumizing the roots? - i have tried using a diffuser (multiple brands &amp; types) it just frizzes up my hair.

2- can my bottom layers further curl?

3- I’m planning to get bangs professionally cut (but not by a curly hair expert). The cut would be where my curls start to form, would this mean i won’t have curly bangs? (because again the roots to midsection is flat and straight)

All of my hair got curlier, softer and smoother when I cut almost all oils and butters from my products. The products I use with oils (Giovanni shampoo, conditioner, leave-in) have a light oil (sunflower) towards the middle of the ingredient list. I also use the VO5 Extra Body and Kiwi Lime conditioners. I can use heavier (Shea Moisture coconut rehydration mask) deep conditioners and be ok, and use the shampoo and conditioner from the same line more in the winter to protect my hair from the dry, cold air. 

I can't co-wash either. Not routinely or regularly at least. When I just need to rinse sweat and pollen from my hair, once a week in the summer it's ok with a light conditioner (Giovanni Direct Leave-in), but otherwise, it's just a disaster.

I also can't leave any regular conditioner in my hair as a leave-in. It looks heavy and weighed down and feels gross. Sometimes, I use my leave-in conditioners as a rinse out if my hair doesn't feel particularly dry.

I have to clarify my hair 1-2x/month to remove hard water buildup. That can also weigh down my hair, make it frizzy for no reason, and give a rough feeling to my hair. I have predominately calcium and magnesium deposits in my water.

For frizz, I tend to add more leave-in conditioner that i emulsify in my hands with some warm water and kind of glaze over my hair. If I have a curl that just totally loses shape, I will wet it with my hands, add some more leave-in and maybe some gel if I used it, and rescrunch that one piece. I do the same if I get a knot or tangle, work through it with water and a light leave-in, rescrunch and let it dry.

Adding more layers on top can also help the hair curl more. I get long layers put in twice a year with my trims and it definitely helps things curl up more on the top layer.

Good luck!",3a

32979,/r/curlyhair/comments/9su6dl/advice_on_gel_use_and_dry_hair/,"Advice on gel use and dry hairHi,

I have pretty course, highly porous hair. I have been using CGM for a month, and while I have great curl definition and better 2nd and 3rd day hair than I have in years (used to have 3a hair), I can't seem to get the texture to not feel like straw. I have tried some leave in products, but they build up on my hair quickly. If I use leave in conditioners or oils, my hair feels gross and like I just put grease over dry hair. If I don't use leave in conditioners, my hair frizzes and feels like hay. Either way it LOOKS like I have product in my hair. My hair is naturally blonde. Obviously, my routine changed when my curl pattern changed, but my hair feels god-awful. 

Routine: I use a Deva low-poo once a week and Paul Mitchell shampoo 2 clarifying once-twice a month (depending on if I need it). (I have hard water and my landlord doesn't allow us to tamper with the faucets, so a softener is out of the question.) I then s2c a Deva conditioner and rinse it mostly out (it makes my hair cakey if I leave much in). While still upside down I apply a pump or two of argan oil, a pump of Shea Moisture Leave in conditioner only on the ends, and plop. It takes my hair forever to even get to damp level, so I plop for 15 minutes (it's still pretty wet) and add another small pump of the shea moisture leave in conditioner. Add small clips all over to kind of faux scrunch and diffuse until damp. Then I take out clips, add a LOT of DevaCurl Ultra gel to damp hair (if I add it when it's any wetter, it's like I didn't put any in there at all). Then diffuse to 90% and air dry the rest. Scrunch out the crunch. 

TL;DR: The curl pattern looks great with this routine, my hair doesn't look that caked up anymore, but it now FEELS AWFUL. It still feels so dry and kind of matted even though it doesn't really look like it. Is this normal? Because I can't stand to touch it. ",3a
13854,/r/curlyhair/comments/gd4amx/im_so_confused/fpheowh/,"I have 2a-2c hair and have straight hair when using silicon-containing products, especially when there is low humidity. I think some people just have hair that is more malleable. In the past, if you used a curling iron, did your hair hold the curl (with hairspray or whatever) or did it fall easily no matter what you did? People who actually do have straight hair often can't get any hold from a curling iron while people who have wavy/curly hair that often can look straight because of silicones do get good results with a curling iron.

 So, with silicones (and drying sulfate conditioners) your hair may look straight but when following CGM and staying away from silicones (even the CGM-approved water soluble ones) your hair may start to wave/curl, especially when there's more humidity in the air. This is how my hair works and I think it's great because it means that I can have waves/curls sometimes and straighter hair sometimes. I can still even have a blow-out look following CGM methods by altering my routine and just using leave in and then putting my dry hair up in a satin scrunchie in a bun to get big, blown-out looking waves. 

But, if you want your hair to be more stick straight, you can also go back to using silicones and blow drying, etc. There's nothing really wrong with it and it is your hair :).  For my hair though I get split ends much faster when using silicones and sulfate shampoos than when following CGM. 

 Also, hair changes a lot between childhood and adulthood - your hair that was stick straight as a kid might just be more textured now.",2c

My current routine involves cowashing with the standard Tresemme conditioner. After my shower, I squish water out of my hair with a shirt and use the praying hands method to apply LA sports gel; then I scrunch the gel in until my hands are on fire. Plop for an hour, let it airdry, then I throw it up in a pineapple without SOTC (although this doesn't seem to work, so I'll be changing that. I also just bought my first diffuser!!) Sometimes I'll use a few other products before gel, like Bella Curls Curl Defining Creme or Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I deep condition once every week or two with Shea Moisture Coconut Oil.

1. My hair naturally parts further over to the right, so I have a ton of hair over to the right and not a lot on the left. Consequently, my right is fairly well defined and voluminous, but my left side is lacking. My left side is more like waves. I also tend to sleep on my left side, which really doesn't seem to help. What can I do to help my left side live up to the right without having to change my part?
2. How does one know when to clarify? I'm having a hard time determining it.
3. On day 2-3, my curls are pretty much waves - which I'm fine with - but the frizz is horrible. Some parts even look totally straight! How can I help redefine my waves/curls? I have a spray bottle and numerous products at my disposal :)

https://i.redd.it/r09gmcmn0ze21.jpg

I just started CG kind if...well only dipping my toe in. I bought some product, but only cheap ones and not the ones recommended as I didn't see that until after I bought stuff. I won't bother to list the products as they're probably not what anyone would recommend or know the brand to anyways. But to sum up. I deep conditioned my dry, fine hair. Put a mousse on the roots, praying hands gelled (light hold) my hair with it over my head. Squished the gel in. Squished the water out. Used a t-shirt to squish more water out. Plopped for...half hour or so. Then let it air dry with a little leave-in conditioner and once dry, SotC. 

I think for my first attempt it came out pretty great. Though I'm not used to how much volume I suddenly have. Second picture after two/three days I washed it and started again. Did the same routine but the hair didn't come out quite as nice. The second picture is me today on my second day curls after I woke up, wet my hair a little with leave in conditioner spray and scrunched in some foamy mousse. I like how it turned out for second day hair. 

I guess I write all this to ask...I'm still not sure what my hair type is though. The parts by my ears are a full curl that corkscrew. Which I thought was like a 3a. But then most of my hair is more 2b I think? The underside and back tend to be either almost straight or very little wave, more 2a. So I don't know if I should just stick with what I'm doing with my crappier gel and stuff because this is as good as I can hope for? Or if I actually spent the money to get the CG recommended products, if I would get less frizz and softer, more defined curls (especially on the second day). But maybe I'm hoping for too much when it comes to curls and I should just stick to waves? 

But on the third day, though my hair isn't greasy or in need of a wash really, it just gets to frizzy I have to cave and brush it all out so it's just waves. It still looks okay I guess. I don't have a picture of that though.

1. Too much product is likely to make your hair greasy and buildup quicker, especially if your hair is low porosity or fine. It won't damage your hair though. If your hair is really dry, use both a leave-in and a curl cream. If it's not, you can use a curl cream alone. Most, if not all, curl creams are water based and will moisturize the hair. The SheaMoisture curl enhancing smoothie is a moisturizer on its own. Over time, I've simplified my routine to cleanser, conditioner, leave-in, and gel for wash and gos. After it's dried, I use a light oil and praying hands method to remove crunch. On days when I do protective styles, I'll do LCO method (leave-in, cream, oil).

2. The best way to grow your hair faster is to take care of it. Growth rate is determined by genetics, but most people struggle with maintaining the hair and it results in breakage, especially at the ends. Deep condition regularly, protect your hair ends and scalp massages. Scalp massages help with bringing blood flow to the scalp and helps with nutrient uptake of the follicles.",3b

My hair is fine (but I have a lot of it) 2a on top and 2b underneath, medium low porosity, shoulder length. Before I started CG my hair was straight in the front and on top. When I was young (like middle school) I had beautiful 2C curls. I’m wondering if I can ever get them back. 

Current routine: 

I apply all products in the shower upside down. I shampoo every other wash using Not Your Mothers Naturals (the pink one). Then I condition with the Tresemme Botanique. I put a bunch in, let it sit for ~2 min, S2C, then add more. Then I detangle using a wide tooth comb, S2C again, and scrunch wet hair with a cotton shirt to remove excess water and conditioner. I apply LA looks gel (quarter sized amounts to different sections of hair, totaling to about a fig size) using prayer hands. Plop for 15 mins, diffuse until ~50% dry. Air dry the rest and SOTC. I sleep with my hair plopped in a cotton T-shirt. 

Issues I’m having:

My hair feels waxy after SOTC. It never feels like soft and bouncy curls. 

I get some pretty nice clumps in the shower after S2C and detangling, but they go away as soon as my hair is anything but soaking wet. I have no idea how to preserve them, because my curl pattern when dry is very stringy. 

I have NO volume. I’m hoping to get a hair cut this month to maybe help this. 

Things I’ve tried:
-applying gel as demonstrated by Powerdomi (pulsing gel in two clumps). No obvious difference in results. 
-applying gel at different stages of wetness (sopping wet, lightly damp, etc). No matter what, my hair is waxy after SOTC. 
-I’ve tried protein treatments, as my hair is very limp. I tried both the Hask keratin protein mask and a rice water rinse. Neither made an obvious difference in my hair (if anything they made it MORE stringy and limp). 

I’m just about at the end of my bottle of Tresemme conditioner, so I’m looking for product recommendations to replace that. I also would love some recommendations for gel to replace the LA looks. I tried the Herbal Essences mixed berry mousse, but it doesn’t have enough hold. I also tried Kinky Curly curling custard but it doesn’t have enough hold and makes my hair waxy like the LA looks gel.

whenever i try s2c, i find that the roots of my hair are sticking to my scalp whch leads to a very weird curl where the root of my curl is flat due to the sticking, and as a result my hair just curls weirdly. i don't know if its because of the scrunching with the conditioner, and my hair just can't handle that much conditioner, or something else but i was wondering if there was any way to solve this? if not, i was thinking of just going back to my old way of just rinsing out my conditioner upside down and then scrunching in my products, which seemed to work better.

but in general, i've noticed some weird hair problems lately. the hair in the middle of my head is very dry, like no matter how much conditioner i put in it always just is dry. i've always noticed that my curls have lately seemed to be falling much flatter with less volume than usual. i've tried both a protein treatment and a cleansing treatment as i do use silicone in one of my products, and that hasn't seemed to work. i can't tell if it's because the hair on top of my head has been growing somewhat long, and perhaps the weight is just causing the curls to fall flat? idk, i was just wondering if anyone had any potential suggestions for me/answers.",3c

However, when it was first cut, and I did my usual routine, it was looking a little like it’s old self. So I decided to break the rules and wash it straight away again the next day, which has made it bounce into the beautiful, voluminous, curly mess that I got in the salon. 


Routine:
• Haven’t straightened hair since January 2018
• Have been following the CGM since January 2018

• Soak hair in shower, squeeze out all excess moisture (as hairdresser said) so the hair isn’t sopping wet. 
• Apply Garnier Ultimate Blends Hair Food In Banana and Shea Butter, untangling my hair with my fingers and raking in the product. 
• Again, squeezing in the product and squeezing out excess moisture. 
• Leaving the mask to sit for 2 hours, watch some Netflix. 
• Back I’m shower, wash out hair mask with cold water for 8 seconds. 
• Extra conditioner - TRESemmé Botanique, again, squishing our extra moisture, applying conditioner, raking it through hair, and squeezing out the excess - leave for 3 minutes. 
• Wash out the conditioner in 8 seconds, turn shower off. 
• Squeeze our water, apply Shea Moisture JMCO leave-in by raking it through and squishing it in. 
• Apply Boots Curl Creme by raking it through hair. 
• Squish all of the hair together so everything saturated into the hair. 
• Scrunch upwards and waddle across the hall with my head upside down. 
• Grab a microfibre towel and scrunch out excess moisture. 
• DO NOT PLOP
• Diffuse, low heat + medium heat in bursts of 20 seconds per section with head flipped upside down the entire time. 
• Diffuse until neck gets stiff and hair feels 100% dry. 
• Style into the position I want my hair and realise it isn’t ACTUALLY 100% dry. 
• Diffuse the rest standing up with hair in the style I want.

My hair journey since January has been amazing, my hair has changed an incredible amount since I have been taking care of it, and my curls are actually BOINGING. 
I will definitely be posting updates. ",2b
12395,/r/curlyhair/comments/dzj277/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/f8wlvcc/,"Hey guys! I've been having a few problems with my hair. I have slightly above the shoulder 2B-2C (or just barely 3a) hair with normal-ish (on the lower spectrum) porosity and little damage. 

My current routine involves cowashing with the standard Tresemme conditioner. After my shower, I squish water out of my hair with a shirt and use the praying hands method to apply LA sports gel; then I scrunch the gel in until my hands are on fire. Plop for an hour, let it airdry, then I throw it up in a pineapple without SOTC (although this doesn't seem to work, so I'll be changing that. I also just bought my first diffuser!!) Sometimes I'll use a few other products before gel, like Bella Curls Curl Defining Creme or Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I deep condition once every week or two with Shea Moisture Coconut Oil.

1. My hair naturally parts further over to the right, so I have a ton of hair over to the right and not a lot on the left. Consequently, my right is fairly well defined and voluminous, but my left side is lacking. My left side is more like waves. I also tend to sleep on my left side, which really doesn't seem to help. What can I do to help my left side live up to the right without having to change my part?
2. How does one know when to clarify? I'm having a hard time determining it.
3. On day 2-3, my curls are pretty much waves - which I'm fine with - but the frizz is horrible. Some parts even look totally straight! How can I help redefine my waves/curls? I have a spray bottle and numerous products at my disposal :)

I do tresemme, then, without squeezing any water out, I use a very small amount of la gel because it gives me really good clumping and definition. Then I squish out excess water and apply a larger amount of biolage ultra defining gel. It's from Sally beauty and will not break the bank. 

Using just la looks weighs down my hair way too much. Just biolage didn't give good definition. The two together work really well.  Wish I hadn't spent so much on product before figuring this out.

Then I squish with a microfiber towel. Plopping never seemed to do much for me, so I quit. &amp; i diffuse later if I an feeling ambitious. I also use a cala tangle free brush when I condition. Found it at TJ Maxx for cheap and love it.

Honestly not cg approved, but I'm working on it

Shampoo: Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Shampoo

Conditioner: Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Conditioner

Deep condition: OGX argan oil deep conditioner

Hair products: Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Smoothie, and occasionally some lavender almond oil on the ends as needed

Wash day routine: prepoo with olive oil or sunflower oil, shampoo, condition, comb hair with conditioner in it, then deep condition for +/- 15 minutes. Rinse 80% out. Apply curling smoothie with praying hands and raking it through, detangling any knots I missed. Let it dry, sometimes down, sometimes in a loose bun.

I shampoo as needed, since it depends on weather, buildup, and such. I condition every other day. I put my hair in a pineapple or topknot to sleep.

Also, if anyone has any idea, can you help me figure out my curl type? It's usually a mix of 2b/2c/3a, with a few 3b spots, but I might be wrong. My hair has changed a lot as I've gotten older, so all help is welcome!",3b

Reset wash with VO5 clarifying shampoo kiwi lime squeeze. 

Deep condition with two egg yolks, two tbsp olive oil, two tbsp honey. Leave on for 30 minutes. (Should’ve done double the amount for my thick AF hair.) 

No co-washing for reset day. 

Conditioner after deep conditioning with Cantu Shea Butter for natural hair conditioning co-wash applied by scrunching in divided sections in shower. Didn’t rinse it out completely and let it act as a leave-in. 

Gel: Giovanni LA hold styling gel extreme hold. Applied to sopping wet hair by scrunching. 

Drying: Tried plopping with a microfiber towel, failed miserably, so I gently scrunched with the microfiber towel. 

Diffused to mostly-dry with low temperature on low speed. Then scrunched in some Aunt Jackie’s seal it up hydrating sealing butter and Shea Moisture silicone free miracle styler leave-in treatment which smells like all the pre-teen boys in 1999. 

My hair is enigmatic. It has changed so much. As a small child I had stuck straight brown hair that turned BLONDE in the sun- it looked like my mom had given me blonde chunky highlights. Eventually it turned to perfect-poo-brown and started to get volume and minimal waves some time during elementary school. The waves increased in middle school and would full-on curl beneath my shoulders if I slept with wet hair. That’s how it stayed but it was the mid 2000’s when I started high school and I straightened the bejeezus out of it. Then I wore it up constantly for years when my step mom gave me a mullet, A MULLET, without my consent. (She is a professional and even owns her own salon. I think she hated me.) 

So now I have apparently 2a-c coarse strands with lots of natural volume at the roots from a full crown of a cowlick. Literally. It swirls fully around the top of my head. 

Porosity you ask? Not a clue. My hair has features of high a low porosity despite it being virgin hair that never sees heat. I just cut off three inches the other day because of how dry and sad it gets past my ears. The cuticles were chipped all over, a real tragedy. Hopefully throwing all of the moisture at it with CG will help that!!!

Does everyone wash/detangle/apply product upside down? If I do that then my hair basically sticks straight out from my ears when I dry.

But if I do everything right side up, I can’t get any lift (tried clipping, other techniques I saw on YouTube). 

My hair is quite fine, mostly wavy (2b/2c and occasional 3a) and very long. I do plan on cutting soon. I have to comb it in the shower with a detangler comb (wide tooth alone doesn’t cut it).

I’ve tried a bunch of different combos of products and methods but nothing seems to be leaving me with hair that isn’t a rats nest before even scrunching. Am I an idiot an just missing something basic here?",2c
15694,/r/curlyhair/comments/alqc20/9_months_with_the_cg_method_my_hair_has_been/efg1tur/," I have 3a, protein loving, low porosity hair. Fighting frizz and staying moisturized are definitely my main challenges with this hair type.   

Current routine:  

I wash every 4-5 days depending on my schedule/how my hair is looking. 

Wash days:  

1. Co-wash with **Eden Bodyworks Coconut Co-Wash**. I really scrub my scalp and then soak my hair with this stuff and finger comb to detangle. Then I clip it all up and throw on a shower cap. Set the shower to hot to create steam to open up the hair shaft and allow the moisture to soak in. Really important step for low porosity hair! Otherwise the product just sits on top of your hair and doesn't actually moisturize the way it should. Rinse well with cold or cool water.  

2. Deep condition with **SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Hair Masque**. I use squish to condish here plus add a little extra closer to the scalp too. Clip up, shower cap, hot steam (same set up as above). Rinse completely with cold or cool water.  

3. Apply **SheaMoisture Low Porosity Protein-Free Leave-in** using S2C method. I'm actually thinking of swapping this product out with something else for a little extra moisture and protein (any recommendations?? Let me know!). It seems to work well on days 1 and 2, but I also use my leave-in to refresh my hair each morning, and I think this product isn't quite moisturizing enough/doesn't have enough protein for my hair.  

4. Apply **Biotera Alcohol Free Defining Gel** using S2C method. It makes my hair clump up nicely and creates a light gel cast. 

5. Scrunch out water with a cotton T-shirt. I usually just air dry after this, but if I'm more in a hurry I will diffuse on low temp using the pixie method until about 30% dry then air dry the rest of the way. Scrunch out the crunch once it's completely dry. 

Non-wash days: 

I sleep with a silk pillowcase, which helps a lot with avoiding frizz while you sleep. Seriously, this makes a huge difference! 

\- On days 2-3, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair and apply some SM leave-in (listed above) and then biotera gel using S2C method for both. Air dry then scrunch out the crunch. 

\- On days 3-4, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair and use the SM leave-in and **ECO Aloe Vera Styling Gel** using S2C method. This gel has a stronger hold and is good for re-forming curls that have come undone over the first couple of days. Air dry then scrunch out the crunch.  

Notes:  

\-Every month or so, I will also cleanse my hair with whatever cheap shampoo we have in the shower to get rid of any build-up.

\-If my hair is particularly dry and frizzy (usually in winter months), I will also do extra deep conditionings on day 3 by rinsing my hair with cool/cold water and applying SM Manuka &amp; Mafura Hair Masque (same as above). Then I clip up my hair, put on a shower cap, and diffuse over the cap on medium temp for 10-20 minutes. Rinse out completely with cool/cold water. This really helps me keep up with much-needed moisture. ",3a

I picked this up at Winners for $8 and was pretty excited because I have read mostly positive things about Giovanni. I used it in my regular routine: Devacurl No-Poo shampoo and Oneka unscented conditioner (I have shoulder length 2c/3a hair). I applied about a tablespoon of the gel to nearly dripping wet hair with praying hands, then used a comb to distribute the gel, then finally squished from tips to roots. I plopped for a 1/2 hour then air dried.

* While dry: great gel cast, curls have pretty good definition, gel has a nice smell
* After SOTC: not much volume but good definition, hair felt weighed down
* After a few hours: lots of frizz forming, some loss of definition
* Next morning (pineapple scrunchie and satin pillowcase): hair feels crusty and dry, lots of frizz everywhere. Throughout the day today I've noticed chunks of white flakes from the gel stuck to my hair. Lots of tangles, which I haven't had in a very long time.

I washed endless YT videos and stalked this sub and think I’ve finally found the best thing to do for my 2b waves &amp; hopefully others can benefit also! I have my routine posted in full on a prior post here with links to every product if anyone’s curious!

1. Knowing if you need a protein treatment or deep conditioning treatment. I did the rice water soak and I think it did more harm than good. But I got a sample of the Cantu deep treatment hair masque and followed their instructions before my most recent wash day and my hair just felt so much better. I had far bigger clumps, more definition, and it’s sooooo soft now.

2. Double gel application. I can’t recall the YouTuber who talked about this, but it helped my a ton. My routine is usually leave in, curl cream, and gel, plop for about 20 min (I have A LOT of hair) and diffuse. But I’ve recently started adding a second coat of gel after plopping and for the first time I’ve been getting a really great gel cast!

3. SLEEPING WITH THE GEL CAST. Y’all when I say I woke up this morning in disbelief, I was in shock. I bought one of those cheap silk head scarves from target &amp; sort of plopped my dry, gel casted hair into the scarf very loosely and slept like that. I’ve noticed with my kind of waves, a pineapple just doesn’t do it and I have to do a huge refresh every morning and it sucks. I get very frizzy and flat overnight even though I don’t toss &amp; turn much at all. But once I took off the scarf this morning, I was amazed at how voluminous my hair was and how beautiful my waves were. Sleeping had helped SOTC a bit and I used a tiny bit of oil in the morning to get the rest of the crunch out and my hair feels healthier than it EVER has. I’m so delighted and amazed. There are finally some 2c curls in there and best of all, the underneath layer of my hair (which is almost always flat and poofy and sad) has big beautiful waves.

Obviously I don’t know how this would work on other curl types, but I figured I’d share these tips to those struggling when starting out like I was!",2b

I finally did a little more research and found out that I have low porosity hair so I decided to change when I apply my curl cream and gel. The following is my routine:

I use Ogx Nurishing Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner (I think they're CG, but not 100% positive). I shampooed like normal (which is every day) by raking my fingers through my hair to detangle. I then applied conditioner and squished it in. For many years now I have let the conditioner stay in my hair while I wash my body so I did that as well. When I washed it out, I scrunched in the water and squeezed the water out that way. Then I immediately applied Oliology Coconut Oil Curl Cream (pretty sure not CG) with prayer hands and scrunched. Then I plopped in a t-shirt for like 5 minutes. Then I applied Devacurl light defining gel with prayer hands and scrunched some more. I then let it air dry. When it was dry I scrunched out the crunch and fluffed a little. I may try the gel in my hair while still wet to help with frizz, but I'm really pleased with the curl. I think I have 3a with some 3b in there.

This is my curly hair cut experience with 3b curly hair.
My cut a year ago was my one biggest hair regret because I now have too many layers. I got 360 “layers” that are pretty thick.

I have to try and moisturize a bunch of different layers and the dry/split ends are hard to trim since they are all different sizes. It’s like spreading dry/split ends from only the ends if your hair to all over your hair. Its made me really unhappy with my hair and the layers take forever to grow and as they grow they get dry and split so I continue to attempt to trim. Trimming is also harder when you have 10 different lengths scattered all over. My hair is now a bunch of different sizes With too many layers.

Blunt cuts or very minimal layers seem to  make curly hair stronger and overall much easier to grow out and maintain healthy. Tons of layers = hard to grow out and more exposed ends. My layers seems to expose the hair to more damage but more difficult to trim. Sighs*

The point here is to take precaution and think about your hair type and it’s growth rate. Make sure you notice how much people are trimming! I had no idea how much had been cut until it was too late. I also didn’t think about how much trouble it would cause my hair long-term, imy hair looked great!

I think curly dry cuts can be awesome and manageable if not overdone!   Face framing is great because it isn’t much hair . I will continue to dry cut my hair and face frame  as well. 
However, I would take HEAVY precaution against cutting 360 layers and reaaaally think about how much and how short. 

Good luck curlies💖",3b

Now I’m doing the official CG method and I’m just wondering how long it’ll take to see change - and if any change will even happen. I have 2c-3A hair and my routine is as follows:

Wash once a week with DC shampoo
Condition with DC decadence, leave most of it in 
Use LA looks gel or DC gel
Diffuse at 50% dry, SOTC with Trader Joe’s argan oil. 

Tbh, there’s slightly less frizz but the difference is pretty negligible and I can’t really get that happy medium between too much gel and tons of definition, and not enough gel and tons of frizz. Using a styling cream contributes to that “producty” feeling in my hair. Pineappling doesn’t do anything to preserve and neither does a satin bonnet or pillowcase. 

I’m just at a loss. I told my BF that it would be easier to just blow my hair out straight once a week because this just doesn’t seem worth it anymore. I’m not seeing noticeably healthier hair, I’m not seeing more curls. I’ve been doing this for almost 5 years now and it’s just so frustrating.

I do live in a relatively humid place (usually 40%+) so that could definitely be part of the issue but I’m unsure what steps to take to combat this nonetheless.

I either shower or wet my hair using a spray bottle with a little bit of the Tresemme botanique coconut and aloe conditioner mixed in to the water in the spray bottle. 

I only wash my hair every Sunday with the Shea Moisture moisture retention shampoo with sea kelp and Aragon oil but I use conditioner everyday (Tresemme ^) by just smoothing it on below my ears, waiting a minute, using a wide tooth comb to distribute and then rinsing it out. I then take a tiny bit more of conditioner and do S2C. I also use the Garnier 1 minute coconut conditioner mask for roughly 20 minutes on wash days. 

I squeeze the majority of the water from my hair because I hate the way wet hair feels on my back and then I scrunch in Herbal Essence totally twisted curl mousse, then a tiny bit of LA looks sports gel, then I scrunch with a microfiber towel until I get the wave pattern I’m going for, then air dry!

If that doesn’t work, consider googling the water profile of your area to see if you can find it’s hardness.  Hard water buildup needs a chelating agent, Disodium EDTA being one of them.  In the UK I’m using a clarifying shampoo by Tresemme because it’s cheap and does the job.

It has sulphates and is pretty drying, but no silicones.  I find hard water buildup stops my products working on my hair, including my conditioners. So the cleanse is drying but also helps my moisturisers work a lot better.

My hair stopped growing since I was damaging it by straightening it, so I decided that I would be natural and that I needed to find a routine.

2-Oil to keep it moisturized and help it grow

Eco styler gel is really good for 3c/4a hair like mine. Don’t let the perfect curls in the front fool you there are some kinks in the back lol. The gel is soft on curls but hard against the environment which is why my curls stayed 3 days later.

Castor Oil is crazy thick... like super thick, but honestly without it my hair wouldn’t have grown as fast from my big chop.

To answer your question about your ends- try using a perm curl rod at the end with some gel. It will force a curl however it won’t make it as curly as your roots.

I shower daily and pre-CG shampooed daily too. I still shower daily and I do get my hair wet each time (it’s doable for me because my hair is fine and thin so doesn’t take a crazy long time to dry. Drying time is probably the main reason some people don’t wash or even wet their hair every day). 

I co wash daily with Tresemme coconut and aloe conditioner or mill creek biotin conditioner if my hair needs the protein. I only use herbal essences totally twisted gel to style, and I style about 4x a week. Every 5-7 days I wash with Giovanni 2chic anti frizz which is a low poo shampoo, and I follow it with garnier’s coconut 1 minute treat hair mask. Once every 4-6 weeks I do a cleansing wash with neutrogena anti residue shampoo just to thoroughly clean, and follow it with the garnier mask cuz sulphates dry my hair right out. 

I’d say if your hair takes ages to dry, consider washing it less often and using leave-in conditioners. If it dries reasonably quick or you’re ok with diffusing or just waiting, then co wash or low poo wash as often as you feel you need to. Co wash and low poo don’t strip your scalp so they can be done daily without damage. The one thing I *wouldn’t* do is use a sulphate shampoo more than 1x a week at most. It’s incredibly stripping and drying.",2a

I'm willing to try out new products (have been looking to Shea Moisture mainly), but ideally nothing more than 10$ per product. My current routine is as follows:

* Shampoo with Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying Shampoo once a month, sometimes longer or shorter
* Cowash with TRESemme Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish every 3-5 days
* Deep condition with Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Yogurt Mask every other week.
* On off days I scrub my scalp with lukewarm water (never hot!), give myself a little head massage, and rinse with color water. Scrunch out excess water and/or scrunch with cotton t-shirt and let air dry. Shift the roots a little bit for extra volume.

I feel like my current routine is pretty nice so far, and have, again, noticed a lot of improvement in hair health overall, but I feel that with the right products, I can get more definition and volume.

I've been considering the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Intensive Repair mask as a primary moisturizing deep conditioner, and substituting the Intensive Repair mask on days that I need that extra moisture. However, my hair tends to lose the majority of its curl if I use too heavy of products. I would say on a good day, I can get 2c/3a curls in the front/bangs (I don't know why I only get them here), with mostly 2a/2b waves in the back/sides of my hair.

Instead of cowashing today, I opted to try out a different method to retain volume, as I struggle with losing volume on wash day - I did a sort of Praying Hands condition halfway down my hair - but since it's so short currently (sides are ear length while the back almost reaches my neck), I focused mainly on the ends. I then rinsed this out after 15 minutes or so, then reapplied some conditioner to the tips. This really helped to retain some semblance of volume in my har.

Would a leave in conditioner work better for this method?

I am also looking for a gentle shampoo to use once or twice a month so that I can stretch out the time until I use my sulfate shampoo to remove more stubborn build up.

Wash Day Routine: My hair is prone to dryness so usually day 2 is my best day. On wash day, it's B&amp;B curl shampoo and conditioner. I usually half wash out the conditioner. I then apply a dab on moroccan oil to very wet hair using praying hands. Then, having hair upside down, I add devacurl arc gel (amazing stuff!) using praying hands then scrunch 5-7 times. I then turn my head up and split my hair into two sections and make sure to scrunch the back of my hair as it sometimes doesn't get enough scrunch otherwise. I use a microfiber towel to pick up extra drops, srunching dry at the roots 5 or so times. Once it dries completely, I put my hair upside down and shake out the roots gently and scrunch the dry hair so it's softer curls and more volume. 

Day 2: Spritz my hair with warm water mixed w a dab of conditioner. I then apply an avocado protein cream or B&amp;B leave in conditioner and scrunch slightly. I have to scrunch lightly as otherwise it will frizz. If I see any especially unruly pieces, I twist the strand around my finger. Then, I place my thumb at the root, using my other hand to wrap the strand around the thumb and pin it to my head, inserting a bobby pin between the loop left by my thumb. I wait till it's mostly dry, maybe 15 minutes. After, I shake out upside down and pick at some strands to add life.",3a

Previous post, routine:

Hello curlies and wavies!

I  just discovered this forum and I think it's so funny that I have even  dubbed myself ""secretlycurly"" but only now just discovered there is help  to bring my curls back out of the shadows (I hope)! :-) The reason I  chose that handle is that I used to have great, well-defined waves...  until I was diagnosed with terrible contact allergies to a number of  really common substances (linalool, a plant-derived ingredient in most  fragrances is the worst offender). Since then, I have had to pare down  my product list to nearly nothing. I have spent countless hundreds of  dollars trying various products and breaking out, or trying to home-make  products and ending up with a greasy/oily disaster. About a year ago I  found Jessicurl unscented products and so far (knock on wood) I have had  no eczema reactions from the styling products I use, although I found  the shampoo is a bit harsh and makes my eyelids sting, so I avoid that.  Here is my current routine and products:

1. Wash and condition every other day with Free &amp; Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner
2. Avoid conditioning roots, but let conditioner sit on ends while in shower for about 5 minutes
3. Towel  turban with a regular cotton towel while I dry off, then use a hair  pick to get the tangles out and part my bangs, then scrunch Jessicurl  unscented rockin' ringlets into mostly wet hair. Blowdry bangs only and  let the rest air dry. Sometimes I blowdry bangs first. Sometimes I let  my hair dry more before putting the rockin' ringlets in. Every once in a  while I will try following up the rockin' ringlets with Jessicurl  unscented confident coils, but I often find that it makes my next day  hair extra crispy and unruly.

My  main issue is that my waves are nowhere near as defined as they used to  be, and I feel like my hair is totally dried out and crispy/fuzzy on  the ends (especially on day two) in a way it never was before. I have  not had good luck waking up with second day hair that can be worn out  the door-- I will often wake up to find that it looks like my ends have  been elecrocuted or something. Puffy, frizzy, big, unruly, messy-- hard  to explain. So on the second day I have been using a tapered clipless  curling iron to freshen it up, or sometimes I use a flat iron also.  Reading some of the info here, I am guessing that the crispy ends might  be due to my heat styling without protectant (there is literally nothing  I can use that won't trigger my contact allergies). But, I don't want  to wash my hair every day, and re-applying Jessicurl and/or re-wetting  my hair simply does not work.

**Here's what I'd like to know:**

* Is  the CG routine substantially different for wavies? I worry that  co-washing will make my hair limp and gross since I don't have big  spirals to begin with, but tell me if I'm wrong.... I am willing to try  it if others have seen it work on gentle waves.
* Has  anyone created a CG or wavy routine with ONLY fragrance-free products?  The clarifying shampoos listed are all on my banned list.
* Does  anyone have input on a cut that might enhance my waves the best? I have  tried different variations of side-swept bangs and long layers over the  years as you can see here. It seems that none of the cuts look as good  with the new limited list of products I have to work with. In the olden  days, I was a big fan of Brocato Cloud 9 shampoo/conditioner, Frederick  Fekkai glossing cream, and Bumble and Bumble curl creme. Oh how I miss  those days.

While I am SO grateful for all the information on here and what is has done for my hair, I am feeling more frustrated with my hair routine than I was before. I have 3a curls and I'm still learning to love them. I've had extensions for the last two years and would straighten my hair or sleep with braids in to try and control my curls. I took my extensions out in November and have been using the CGM since. I do like how defined my curls are, but I'm experiencing two major issues that I have not been able to fix:

1: I have one curl on the right back side of my head that just doesn't know what's going on. It starts to curl in one direction and then flips around somehow and starts curling in the other direction. It creates this weird kink in the middle that I just cannot get rid of. It gets worse with diffusing and can happen to the rest of my hair if I'm not careful. It kind of seems like the curl coils up and the bottom part goes through the top and gets flipped around, but it happens when I air dry too. When I let it coil up in my hands halfway through it just switches direction. I hope that makes sense.

2: I can't believe how time consuming this is! It takes forever for my hair to dry and I just don't have the time to sit and diffuse my hair for 45-60 minutes. It makes me want to go back to blow drying my hair straight and being done in 15 minutes. Diffusing almost makes my curls look worse, but if I skip it my hair stays wet for hours. I don't know what to do, I'm just tired of wasting so much time.

Routine: cowash with tresemme every 4-5 days, use cantu curl activator and herbal essences gel, plop, diffuse with the xtava, scrunch. Products work well for me. Curls look nicer when I air dry. I have to rewet it completely everyday, haven't figured out any other way to have nice second day curls.

The very very ends are the only part that’s been processed. I thought before starting anything that my hair might be 2a with some 2b but now I have no idea what’s going on. I ask because I see some people say waves and curls can require slightly different care and when I research products articles group the products by either curl type or curls vs waves. I have ringlets but some pieces on the very top of bottom will be loose waves. So if anyone has hair like mine or can tell me what curl type I have so I don’t mess my hair up by accident please help me lol.

Also I see devacurl recommended constantly and I’d love to use it but right now I just really don’t have the money. Can anyone recommend an affordable drug store(idk Walmart or target or something too) shampoo and conditioner that’s curly girl friendly and won’t weigh my hair down. My hair seems fine so I’m kind of worried that if I use really popular curly hair products that they’ll be too heavy but when I play it safe it never feels like it’s moisturizing enough... So if you have hair like mine please tell me what you’ve found works for you that won’t empty my bank account. I’m a dog walker in college if that gives you the right idea.

My routine so far:

\-I wash my hair with OGX coconut oil shampoo. I used to just use it on my scalp but since I’m using mousse and gel now I wash all my hair (is that okay?)

\-I squish to condish with OGX coconut miracle oil. I might be rinsing too much of the clumping out because I don’t think leaving OGX conditioner in my hair would be a good idea so I’m being cautious and rinsing it all out while still squishing it and hoping its still making a difference

\-I scrunch my hair with garnier totally twisted mousse and plop it. I haven’t been using gel right out of the shower recently because the first time I must have done something wrong because it didn’t come out very good but I think I’ve got the hang of it so I might do that on wash day too now idk.

\-I plop my hair in a shirt for like an hour and take it down to air dry.

\-I've been pineappling overnight. Plopping overnight made my roots really flat.

Refresh:

\-I wet my hair and scrunch with totally twisted mousse and Aussie instant freeze sculpting gel.

I have low porosity 2b-2c hair and it takes up to four or five hours to hair dry (2 or 3 if I diffuse my roots. I never diffuse my ends because it makes my hair frizzy.) I’m looking to cut my drying time. 

I wash my hair every other day because I get stink fast. (I don’t work out, but once I start exercising regularly I will wash my hair everyday. This is just a personal preference. I don’t apply shampoo to my ends, so they don’t get dried out.) I currently use SM shampoo, suave coconut conditioner, then style with garnier leave in (I use the avocado mask as a leave in because it’s extremely lightweight) and the garnier jelly. I style in the shower right after rinsing out my conditioner. 

Has anyone with low porosity tried conditioning first and then shampooing? How does it work out? I’m thinking of trying it and styling after t-shirt plopping. That way I could use less product, which would possibly cut my drying time.

Edit: added my products and goal",2b

1518,/r/curlyhair/comments/bntwvf/help_with_very_low_porosity_fine_waves/en9gwr6/,"I'm no expert as I just realized my hair is legitimately wavy and not just poofy about two months ago. But I also have 2a/2b, fine, low porosity hair, so maybe I can help.

So first off, do you ever do a clarifying wash? I know it's kind of a no-no with the CGM, but my hair is weighed down super easily, so I use a sulfate shampoo about once a week. After my first reset wash, I wasn't going to use it again, but my hair started looking straighter and greasy after just a couple weeks, so I added it back in on a weekly basis.

I also notice that if I use the praying hands method, my waves look really stringy and sad, so I just scrunch my mousse/gel in without smoothing it over praying hands style. I think the praying hands method is more important for people who have curlier hair that scrunching the product into wouldn't work to coat the entire clump. Since waves are more open than ringlets, it's not a big deal.

It could be a protein thing, but my experience with protein is that it's *way way way* easy to overload on when you have low porosity hair because it's essentially coating your hair to strengthen it and we don't have very many nooks and crannies on our strands for it to sit in. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong about that though!

I hope that helps somewhat... Like I said, I'm a little new at this! Also I had my hair behaving so well, but now as the weather is going from late winter to spring, suddenly it seems like I'm going to have to change my routine again :/",2a
9795,/r/curlyhair/comments/acxix0/is_a_devacut_worth_it/edc0g4o/,"In my opinion, it depends on how good the hairstylist is. I’ve had two Deva cuts done by two different stylists, both with a Deva rank of 1, and one was pretty shitty and the other amazing.

So I have dirty blonde, high density, fine, low porosity hair that is 2C-3B; the length was down to my middle back (most recently I cut it to just grazing my shoulders). So whenever I cut my hair, I NEED layers in it or it will poof to a triangle and knot like a son of a bitch. 

The bad stylist seemed like she was listening, but seemed inexperienced and confused that I wanted layers. She cut a little bit of hair, then washed/conditioned with Deva Curl, used light defining gel and then cut the rest. I ended up with a section of hair shorter than the rest, I didn’t notice this until a few weeks later. She also couldn’t explain her styling process to me so I could recreate it at home. She didn’t even cut off that much hair, and my hair ended up being harder to care for. She seemed like she was just following a template and didn’t know how to adjust it for my needs. 

The amazing stylist made me feel like I was the center of her world. She talked to me about what my hair was like and how I dealt with it, then she applied clarifying shampoo for an hour under heat, rinsed it, showed me how to style it and dryed it, then cut it exactly like I wanted it. She gave me so many layers and I love it! Because I ended up cutting so much off, she then rewetted it and styled it (she actually made me do it with guidance from her) to make sure it looked good. Throughout my appointment, she explained the science of why she did what she did (which I loved because I was a chemistry student in college), she showed me a hair routine/products that work for my hair and it is so much faster to do. And she showed me how to use gel effectively for my hair.

My advice is, ask around for a good stylist, see if they have pictures of their work up on social media to confirm that they actually know what they are doing. A good Deva stylist should listen to you, know how to deal with your hair type in terms of washing/conditioning/styling/cutting, and show you how to wash/condition/style your hair so it looks good.

I could desperately use some of your sage advice. This is a bit long so please bear with me. My current curly hair routine is getting out of control and I'm (quite literally) losing sleep over it. 

For context, I decided to embrace my very fine 2b/2c curls a few months ago after straightening them to hell for over 10 years with the hope that going natural would save me time getting ready for work in the morning. After steeping myself in all manner of curly hair routine youtube videos and the information in this sub, I have landed on the following morning hair routine:

1. Wash my hair with Tresseme Keratin shampoo + conditioner. On days that I don't wash it, I just get it wet in the shower.
2. Apply Aveda Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair leave-in conditioner and comb through with a dolman brush to distribute evenly
3. Scrunch Oway Curl Serum below the midshaft.
4. Spray hair with water to get my curls to clump after brushing them
5. Scrunch a generous amount of gel to create a gel cast on wet hair.
6. Let air dry for an hour while applying face creams + makeup
7. Diffuse until mostly dry
8. At this point, I'll go in with a flatiron to curl some of the straight strands in the top layer of my hair to make it match the rest of my curls
9. Apply smoothing serum to tame the remaining frizz

In total, this takes me 2.5 hours every morning and I have to wake up at 5:30 am to get this done and get to work on time. Waking up at the crack of dawn to make sure my hair looks halfway decent before I leave the house is leaving me chronically sleep-deprived.  Not to mention, this is not what I was hoping would happen when I decided to embrace my curls in the hope of saving time. 

Do any of you have any advice on how I could simplify my hair routine to get the sleep that I so desperately need? What does your curly hair routine look like and how long does it take?

Some people can only use it under ideal weather conditions. Some people don't do well with it anytime. I can't use glycerin in dry, cold weather or humid weather. It turns into a frizzy, moist poof or a crispy dry mess, depending on the weather. When it's good, it's great, but in Upstate New York, the conditions are hardly ever ideal for me to get good results with products that have glycerin high up on the ingredient list.

Also, you might not need as many moisturizing ingredients in hot, humid weather. I've been in Florida this time of year, it was unpleasantly hot and humid, and rained everyday. The water in Florida is notoriously hard.

Stop at Walmart or a drug store and get a cheap gel or mousse without glycerin. Aussie Instant Freeze, Suave Max Hold gel, Pantene and Suave both have CG-friendly mousses without glycerin. Also, pick up a bottle of cheap Suave Daily clarifying shampoo. The buildup buster doesn't have the ingredients necessary to remove hard water.

When I went to Florida last year, I used a sulfate shampoo, a cheap VO5 conditioner, the same John Frieda spray and some mousse from Pantene. Had the best hair of my life despite being in Florida during record-breaking rain and winds (which for Florida is some shit!). Used the same routine when I went to the Outer Banks, also in record breaking weather (snow, rain, high winds). Can I get away with that stuff in NY? Not a chance.

Personally I struggle a lot with flat and limp 2b-2c fine high porosity hair too, and though I'm new to the journey what's definitely helped is diffusing upside down, using less product, not using products with heavy coconut oil, castor or jojoba and other oils, glycerin too. Moisture and protein overloading can also cause a lot of the problems you talk about, so balancr is key. Researching dew points and how hair changes during the season changes could also help. A lot of people struggle with season changes since your hair needs change with the transition of season changes.
