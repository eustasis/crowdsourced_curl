0,13111,/r/curlyhair/comments/f8w1qa/heres_to_everyone_who_said_my_hair_was_straight/finutts/,"I wash my hair every 2-3 days, usually 2. I shampoo with tresemme botanique(the sulfate-free solution) usually, but use V05 clarifying shampoo when I feel like I have some build-up. I rinse it out normally. I then apply about a half-dollar amount of NYM royal honey and desert melon(I do all of this rightside up), and brush through my hair with a wide-tooth comb. I leave the conditioner in for around 5-10 minutes, then rinse it out rightside up. I get out of the shower and flip my hair upside down and scrunch out excess water and form curls with a cotton t shirt. Then, I add a dime-sized amount of As I Am Leave-In and then maybe a quarter-sized amount of Kinky Curly Curling Custard. I apply these through scrunching.

My hair takes around 3-4 hours to fully dry, and it holds so much moisture and gets so heavy that my curls get pulled out over and over again. I have to continually scrunch out water and reform the curls because they completely fall out around every 5 minutes. Once my hair is nearly dry, it holds the curl just fine and I just sit and wait for it to air-dry. Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? I don't know why my curls fall out repeatedly whenever they're wet. If I just get them dry then they're perfect.


My routine is pretty simple but I'm definitely going to add a hard-hold gel or mousse in the future. My hair is so fine that the curls just fall out gradually if not being held in place. Anyone have suggestions on how to improve my hair""s ability to maintain a curl/any hard-hold product suggestions?


I consider my hair 2c/3a, very thick, but very fine in texture.


Cutting off a lot of the length certainly helped the curls form, but I am excited to continue growing it out and see how my hair responds.",2c,  wash    hair    every    2 3    days     usually    2     shampoo    tresemme    botanique the    sulfate free    solution     usually     use    v05    clarifying    shampoo    feel    like    build up     rinse    normally     apply    half dollar    amount    nym    royal    honey    desert    melon i    rightside    up      brush    hair    wide tooth    comb     leave    conditioner    around    5 10    minutes     rinse    rightside    up     get    shower    flip    hair    upside    scrunch    excess    water    form    curls    cotton    shirt     then     add    dime sized    amount    leave in    maybe    quarter sized    amount    kinky    curly    curling    custard     apply    scrunching     hair    takes    around    3 4    hours    fully    dry     holds    much    moisture    gets    heavy    curls    get    pulled    again     continually    scrunch    water    reform    curls    completely    fall    around    every    5    minutes     hair    nearly    dry     holds    curl    fine    sit    wait    air dry     anyone    experience    sort    thing     know    curls    fall    repeatedly    whenever    they re    wet     get    dry    they re    perfect     routine    pretty    simple    i m    definitely    going    add    hard hold    gel    mousse    future     hair    fine    curls    fall    gradually    held    place     anyone    suggestions    improve    hair s    ability    maintain    curl any    hard hold    product    suggestions     consider    hair    2c 3a     thick     fine    texture     cutting    lot    length    certainly    helped    curls    form     excited    continue    growing    see    hair    responds   ,wash hair every 2 3 day usually 2 shampoo tresemme botanique the sulfate free solution usually use v05 clarifying shampoo feel like build up rinse normally apply half dollar amount nym royal honey desert melon i rightside up brush hair wide tooth comb leave conditioner around 5 10 minute rinse rightside up get shower flip hair upside scrunch excess water form curl cotton shirt then add dime sized amount leave in maybe quarter sized amount kinky curly curling custard apply scrunching hair take around 3 4 hour fully dry hold much moisture get heavy curl get pulled again continually scrunch water reform curl completely fall around every 5 minute hair nearly dry hold curl fine sit wait air dry anyone experience sort thing know curl fall repeatedly whenever they re wet get dry they re perfect routine pretty simple i m definitely going add hard hold gel mousse future hair fine curl fall gradually held place anyone suggestion improve hair s ability maintain curl any hard hold product suggestion consider hair 2c 3a thick fine texture cutting lot length certainly helped curl form excited continue growing see hair responds,wash hair every 2 3 day usually 2 shampoo tresemme botanique sulfate free solution usually use v05 clarifying shampoo feel like build rinse normally apply half dollar amount nym royal honey desert melon rightside brush hair wide tooth comb leave conditioner around 5 10 minute rinse rightside get shower flip hair upside scrunch excess water form curl cotton shirt add dime sized amount leave maybe quarter sized amount kinky curly curling custard apply scrunching hair take around 3 4 hour fully dry hold much moisture get heavy curl get pulled continually scrunch water reform curl completely fall around every 5 minute hair nearly dry hold curl fine sit wait air dry anyone experience sort thing know curl fall repeatedly whenever wet get dry perfect routine pretty simple definitely going add hard hold gel mousse future hair fine curl fall gradually held place anyone suggestion improve hair ability maintain curl hard hold product suggestion consider hair 2c 3a thick fine texture cutting lot length certainly helped curl form excited continue growing see hair responds

This is my question and I wanna see if anyone else has this problem. I watch a lot of curly hair videos online and really like to pay attention to see how people get defined curls with little frizz.

When I apply my product, I am sure to section my soaking wet hair, rake my product through, and even at times use a denman brush if I feel like I want to really evenly distribute everything and define curl. I also deep condition once a week.

Routine:

I have quite a few ringlets/perfect curls underneath and around my face. I also have wavy pieces that are very soft, but not very curly. Then I have other bits that don't seem to clump at all and look coarse (I'm not sure how to describe it - they aren't frizzy, they just look wiry - my individual hairs are very thick). 

I think I have low-porosity hair... It takes a LONG time for me to get my hair completely wet. I have to really scrub and dig in there to get everything soaking wet.

I use shea moisture coconut and hibiscus shampoo and conditioner. After I condition, I comb/detangle. I don't do it upside down and I don't s2c because I found it just makes my hair frizzy/unclump. Then I use praying hands to apply a leave in and gel (I switch between a few CG-approved products). Then I scrunch a little, plop, then SotC once it's dry.

25,9677,/r/curlyhair/comments/a7to2j/how_do_you_manage_to_have_second_day_hair_when/ec5v8k6/,"I work out for about an hour and a half everyday and have the same problem. My hair is almost waist length, 2c/3a. I ALWAYS braid my hair to workout and this preserves most of my curls, but my scalp also tends to look greasy. I just end up washing it usually, which means my hair is damp most of the time because it takes 12 to 18 hours to fully dry (even though I diffuse it for 10-15 minutes). It's very frustrating. The best solution I've found so far is to simply wash it and pin it up in a french twist with a clip if I'm working that day and need to look professional (and not have my wet hair dripping down my back). If I'm not going out, I just skip washing it and put it up in a bun Kind of gross, but washing my hair constantly dries it out, and working out is far more important to me than second day curls. 

 I'm hopeful that others will have better suggestions for you. If you haven't tried it yet, diffusing might be a good option for you!

I am 1.5 years into my curly hair transformation,  but I'm starting to become really self conscious of my receding hairline, particularly around my temples. I've been seeing a dermatologist, but I'm not a huge fan of starting rogaine which he recommended based on common complaints in reviews.

Do you guys have any recommendations for up-do hairstyles that don't put a lot of stress on my hairline? I have type 3a/3b hair, to my shoulders. I work in a doctor's office (lab coat and all) so that styles need to be of the utmost professional, and my day 2-4 hair is often not well-kept enough to just wear it down.

I woke up amazed with how my hair stayed curly and defined. And it already feels so much healthier!

Routine: I co-wash 2x a week with Renpure Argan Oil conditioner. I primarily use it on my scalp. 

With praying hands I apply 3 minute Miracle Moist deep conditioner on the lengths and then squish to condish and also detangle with a wide tooth comb. I rinse with cold water. 

I do this with my hair flipped downwards.

51,20924,/r/curlyhair/comments/bqn764/thoughts_on_lus_brands/eo66obo/,"I used them for about eight months starting in summer 2018. I have 3a hair (hangs out from 2c to 3b), but more importantly my hair is high porosity from years and years of dyeing and swimming and also, probably, existing, my hair is medium textured (not especially fine or coarse), and dense. My hair loves protein and is very prone to frizz. 

I think LUS is a really great product/system, but it's not the best product for me personally. There's a lot of polyquats in the conditioner and the leave-ins - for me, this meant great results when I first started using it, but eventually turned into build-up and stringyness that I would dry my hair out trying to shampoo out. I want to emphasize that this won't happen to everyone, because everyone's hair is different. 

The products are great value for money - a very little bit goes a long way. In 8 months I think I used maybe two sets of their three-step system, probably less of the shampoo. 

The all-in-one is an excellent refresh product when mixed with water. 

The company has fantastic customer support, seem like good corporate values/ethics, etc.

54,25753,/r/curlyhair/comments/bfpmde/i_dont_know_how_to_have_consistency_in_my_curls/,"I don't know how to have consistency in my curls and how to make them last, what am I doing wrong?So, I started my curly girl journey a month ago, because I wanted my waves/curls to last because they would straighten out after 1h of being awake. I discovered the whole journey, the products everything and I am desperately trying and it's not really working, or not as well as I hoped. There is a hit of an evolution but it's hard for me to see.

I think I'm a 2A-2C but I'm seeing some 3A in there as well when my hair just dried. So I co-wash once a week, deep condition once a week as well (shea moisture deep conditioner), use a leave in (lush rnb) and use a gel (eco styler) for hold. I apply my styling products right after washing and blotting (I blot my hair with a t-shirt) scrunch all the products in, plop it and leave it to air dry, once a month I clarify. I don't really know what to do when my hair is dry for frizz or to refresh them, i wet them a little and put more leave in and gel and it looks okayish but it's still very frizzy. When my curls/waves have a weird shape i'm at a loss. Like a lot of my locks lost their shape and the back of my head of hair is pretty much straight, same for the curls underneath, a lot of the curls are straightened out. Sometimes they come to life but it's barely there. Anyway, So on washing day after it dried my hair looks good, not perfect but really nice, low frizz, nice curl pattern... And then I wake up the next day and they start falling apart again and it just gets worse as the week goes. I don't know what I am doing wrong, any experienced curly girls with tips are very welcome because I am desperate, I honestly about to give up and cry :(

Oh and just fiy before I started my journey all I used was shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner and my curls were gone. I found co-washing helps my oily scalp, it barely gets greasy anymore, i have no scalp itchiness anymore and most of my dandruff is gone so I think my hair is just very very dry.",2a,  know    consistency    curls    make    last     wrong so     started    curly    girl    journey    month    ago     wanted    waves curls    last    would    straighten    1h    awake     discovered    whole    journey     products    everything    desperately    trying    really    working     well    hoped     hit    evolution    hard    see     think    i m    2a 2c    i m    seeing    3a    well    hair    dried     co wash    week     deep    condition    week    well     shea    moisture    deep    conditioner      use    leave     lush    rnb     use    gel     eco    styler     hold     apply    styling    products    right    washing    blotting     i    blot    hair    t shirt     scrunch    products    in     plop    leave    air    dry     month    clarify     really    know    hair    dry    frizz    refresh    them     wet    little    put    leave    gel    looks    okayish    still    frizzy     curls waves    weird    shape    i m    loss     like    lot    locks    lost    shape    back    head    hair    pretty    much    straight     curls    underneath     lot    curls    straightened    out     sometimes    come    life    barely    there     anyway     washing    day    dried    hair    looks    good     perfect    really    nice     low    frizz     nice    curl    pattern       wake    next    day    start    falling    apart    gets    worse    week    goes     know    wrong     experienced    curly    girls    tips    welcome    desperate     honestly    give    cry          oh    fiy    started    journey    used    shampoo     conditioner    leave    conditioner    curls    gone     found    co washing    helps    oily    scalp     barely    gets    greasy    anymore     scalp    itchiness    anymore    dandruff    gone    think    hair    dry   ,know consistency curl make last wrong so started curly girl journey month ago wanted wave curl last would straighten 1h awake discovered whole journey product everything desperately trying really working well hoped hit evolution hard see think i m 2a 2c i m seeing 3a well hair dried co wash week deep condition week well shea moisture deep conditioner use leave lush rnb use gel eco styler hold apply styling product right washing blotting i blot hair t shirt scrunch product in plop leave air dry month clarify really know hair dry frizz refresh them wet little put leave gel look okayish still frizzy curl wave weird shape i m loss like lot lock lost shape back head hair pretty much straight curl underneath lot curl straightened out sometimes come life barely there anyway washing day dried hair look good perfect really nice low frizz nice curl pattern wake next day start falling apart get worse week go know wrong experienced curly girl tip welcome desperate honestly give cry oh fiy started journey used shampoo conditioner leave conditioner curl gone found co washing help oily scalp barely get greasy anymore scalp itchiness anymore dandruff gone think hair dry,know consistency curl make last wrong started curly girl journey month ago wanted wave curl last would straighten 1h awake discovered whole journey product everything desperately trying really working well hoped hit evolution hard see think 2a 2c seeing 3a well hair dried co wash week deep condition week well shea moisture deep conditioner use leave lush rnb use gel eco styler hold apply styling product right washing blotting blot hair shirt scrunch product plop leave air dry month clarify really know hair dry frizz refresh wet little put leave gel look okayish still frizzy curl wave weird shape loss like lot lock lost shape back head hair pretty much straight curl underneath lot curl straightened sometimes come life barely anyway washing day dried hair look good perfect really nice low frizz nice curl pattern wake next day start falling apart get worse week go know wrong experienced curly girl tip welcome desperate honestly give cry oh fiy started journey used shampoo conditioner leave conditioner curl gone found co washing help oily scalp barely get greasy anymore scalp itchiness anymore dandruff gone think hair dry

Low porosity, 2b/c wavy.
Clarify with Cantu cleansing shampoo 1-2 times per week.
Condition with Cantu hydrating cream conditioner- condish upside down and use denman brush to smooth through. Rinse 80% out then add either NYM pink bottle detangler or Cantu Coil calm detangler. 
Once nice clumps are formed, squish to condish in Aussie Instant Freeze gel(3 heaping handfuls)  and squish squish squish.

61,31670,/r/curlyhair/comments/ent8rj/is_my_hair_somewhat_wavy_or_am_i_just_fabricating/,"is my hair somewhat wavy or am i just fabricating thishi all! everyone in this sub has beautiful hair, i'm posting more out of curiosity- trying to assess if i have texture in my hair or not. 

for context, i had very straight hair as a kid naturally, and then around puberty it became frizzy all of a sudden and slightly wavy, like 1b. 

however, i was really bad at taking care of it! i would brush it violently, used elastic hairbands pulled super tight. since i hated the frizz, i got into the habit of straightening my hair daily, without any heat protectant, sometimes applied even on wet hair. i wasn't big on the conditioner, and that which i did use probably had silicones iirc. 

the frizz (and breakage!) got bad enough that i cut off all my hair at 15 y/o and have kept it that way for the last 7 years. i briefly grew it out to be chin-length around 18 but i got that frizz again and cut it off within 6 months of finally growing it out. 

i only recently realized that sometimes excessive frizz on straight hair is indicative of underlying texture. my short hair right now doesn't give me frizz issues and falls mostly straight. i've had some indication my hair may be wavier than i thought (like 2a, 2b?), due to how it looked when it was air-drying out of the shower before i started all that ironing nonsense.. but maybe that was just humidity playing it up. 

my dad's side (which i've gone on more) has super straight hair, 1a-1b, my mom's side has 2b-2c hair... my brother had straight hair in childhood and 2b after puberty too, so it's not out of the question that my hair texture changed slightly. but i'm concerned i'm reading too much into it and will spend a lot of money on products for wavy hair that won't really help me. plus, i don't want to grow out my hair again until i know how to prevent all that frizz. 

i need people more learned than i to assess if i do have wavy hair, and any tips on how to take care of it would be HIGHLY appreciated, esp cheaper products to start with. 

pics below... i still don't condition all that much bc i never know which conditioners have silicone and short hair doesn't need all that as much don't kill me aha

62,2602,/r/curlyhair/comments/fi77z5/very_excited_to_get_more_volume_as_a_2a2b_low/fkfjct0/,"I started trying curls a month ago and was getting really discouraged the first few weeks... About a week and a half ago I finally had a pretty good curl day, and I'm excited that today was even better I think! Still super newbie, but after years of wondering if I had curls/waves, I'm excited to see I have something to work with.

I tried some new products today which I like a lot so far.

Here's the scoop:

My hair: Fine, low-porosity (I think? Or at least, it takes a while to get wet and even longer to dry and heavy ingredients are terrible), 2a and 2b 

* Wash with Inahsi Naturals Soothing Mint Sulfate-free Gentle Cleansing Shampoo
* Apply Inahsi Naturals Mango Hemp Restorative Hair Masque for about 10 minutes, squished into hair 
* S2C Inahsi Naturals Soothing Mint Moisturizing Conditioner, since almost all the way out
* Scruch in a very small amount of Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave-in Conditioner
* Scrunch in small amount of Coconut Avocado Curl Defining Custard
* Scrunch in Not Your Mother's Naturals Blue Sea Kale &amp; Coconut Water Weightless Mousse (quite a lot)
* Scrunch in Bioterra Alcohol-free Defining Gel 

Then: 

* Plop for about 40 minutes (though I may need to change this, it made some funky curls)
* Diffuse about 3/4 dry
* Apply more mousse Smasters-style
* Diffuse the rest of the way (my hair takes FOREVER to dry with any amount of gel)
* Wait for about 30 minutes

66,21946,/r/curlyhair/comments/f6v60y/help_i_dont_know_my_hair_type_or_how_to_define_my/fi76vd5/,"This is my current routine:
Deep condition with As I Am Baobab oil deep conditioner. I put on a shower cap and then a deep conditioning cap for 30 minutes and then rinse out.
I have low porosity hair so I use She’s Moisture’s Low Porosity conditioner and shampoo afterwards.

I then style my hair with Curls Blueberry Bliss Leave -In Conditioner and As I Am’s curly jelly. I seal my hair with Argan oil.

I’ve been wearing my natural hair for approximately 1 month now and I have not been able to get defined curls.

Once a week I use a clay mask to clarify and define my curls but I haven’t seen any real definition. 

The picture above is my hair at 90% dry.

The back of my hair is 3b/3c.
The middle of my hair is...I have no idea
The sides and front of my hair are 3b/3c

I’m not sure what to do to define my curls or make them better.

Any advice would be great.

On the other hand, I can separate my bangs out and clip them, wash them separately while my conditioner sits in the rest of my hair, then clip them again to keep them separate from the plopping process.

81,9117,/r/curlyhair/comments/9drqta/my_curls_always_unpredictable/e5jla17/,"I have 2c(ish) hair most of the time and I haven’t found a solid set of CGM products that I love. Some days my curls come out perfectly and other days blah and separated or just flat. My main issue is that my second day hair is always knotted up underneath... I sleep on a silk pillowcase, I’ve pineappled, used a shower cap, and clipped it up but those all stretched out my curls. No matter what on the second day they’re stretched out but also very tangly underneath and at the ends. 

Top left is most recent 
•washed with deva curl low poo light (with head upside down) 
•conditioned with deva curl light conditioner
•rinsed out (with head upside down) 
•scrunched out most of the water and then used deva curl B’Leave in and scrunched it in then followed up with microfiber towel scrunching
•let air dry while flipping it back and forth often 

Top right is about 3 months ago when I attempted going water only (lasted almost 2 months) and had just done my initial sulfate cleanse with a Kérastase cleansing shampoo and no conditioner because I just wanted to be sure I didn’t add in any silicones. 

Bottom Left is back in April and that day I did my typical deva curl routine, after the low poo shampoo I used the light conditioner, then while wet scrunched in b’leave in and then the gel in sections and diffused. It was beautiful that day but almost too tight and barely and volume on top, despite how much I fluffed it throughout the day. 

Bottom right is from July, right before I got a Deva Cut (not sure how I feel about it) and I used the low poo shampoo and the light conditioner and just let it air dry with no product. 

If anyone has similar hair, fine but a lot of it that tangles easy and is hard to maintain curls during sleep, please lmk if you’ve found anything that works for you!

I’m a 2B/2C with some 3A curls and I’m wanting to get a haircut (it’s been almost 7 months since my last one, which was a trim). I’m on the fence as to whether or not I want to get a devacut or just a regular cut from a salon whose stylists work well with a bunch of textures.  

Main Question: Does wet cutting destroy curl clumps?

I want to ask for layers to help with removing some weight that’s flattening my roots. 

And follow-up question, to those who have gotten a devacut or a standard wet cut, what differences in your hair (or lack) have you noticed? Do you prefer one over the other?

But I want a simple routine, and as zero waste as possible. Every article I read has like 192837 steps and dozillions of different masks each week. That’s just too much for me! How do I start a routine?
Few things:
My hair is extremely oily and thin. So when I co-wash it seems super dirty. 
(I wash it every other day)
I’m considering apple cider vinegar and coconut oil and ditch the conditioner (Apple cider vinegar has a detangler effect they say, but is it enough for curls?) 
Shall I do it?

96,32062,/r/curlyhair/comments/fhf9z7/please_help_me_before_i_damage_my_hair_anymore_my/,"Please help me before I damage my hair anymore. My hair feels like STRAW and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'm desperate.I was so happy when my friend showed me this subreddit. No one else in my family has curly hair, so I never really knew how to take care of it properly; I thought you just shampooed and conditioned it in the same way you would straight hair. I didn't know about casting or plopping or even just the benefits of using a leave in conditioner.

That initial bliss is somewhat gone now...

Recently my hair has been extremely dry and frizzy and unmanageable, even more than it was before I changed my haircare routine to be more curly hair friendly.
Even just brushing it in the mornings has been such a painful experience because it's knotting much more than usual. Another thing that scares me is while writing this I can feel that my scalp has kind of a dull pain, probably from the abuse it goes through in the morning while I brush it.
And my hair is no longer soft, it feels like straw (and I NEVER used to have that issue). It was so bad that I had to resort to using a coconut oil and egg hair mask, which, I know is good for my hair and I should be doing, but the fact it had to use it as a last resort scares me.

I am so scared for the health of my hair right now. Even after the hair mask it still feels... wrong. It still has that straw-like texture.

Here is my full hair routine; I tried to leave nothing out:

I brush my hair before I shower in the morning (I do brush it dry because I heard when you brush it wet your hair tends to break off easier?).
I use a comb, not a brush.
When I shower I will only shampoo when I feel I need to; I don't really have a set schedule. I don't go by if my hair feels oily, I always go by my scalp itself.
I don't shampoo more than twice in a week. But I use conditioner everyday.
I also use a leave in conditioner and gel on the days I know I'm going out (at least 5 times a week).
I try to plop most mornings, but some I really just don't have the time, so I just apply the leave-in conditioner and gel and try to add volume using my hands.
And that's pretty much where it ends. I do everything for my hair in the morning.

Should I be doing more at night? Am I suffocating my hair with all of the products I'm using? Am I supposed to be rinsing them out at the end of the day?

Another question I've always had is (but I feel like I see no one mention in their routines), do most of you shower at night or in the morning? I figured morning was better to get your hair wet and primed, but after my recent experiences, I'm wondering if showering at night is better for rinsing out all of those products.

Just more information that may be useful:

I'm not sure if this is helpful for just hair health advice, but I believe I am  between 2C/3A.

And, although I don't believe my products are the issue themselves but probably how I am using them, they are:

• Maui Moistures Shampoo and Conditioner: Vanilla Bean for Frizzy, Unruly Hair

• Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Leave-In Conditioner

• Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Defining Lotion

97,22530,/r/curlyhair/comments/8rnu1i/calling_all_of_those_with_3b_and_low_porosity/e0tighb/,"I have low porosity, mainly 3C hair with a little 3B thrown in but maybe I can offer a little help. 

I have followed the CG method or a slightly modified version of it for years. I feel like this has been the best thing for my hair.

My method for the past few years: I wash my hair every 3-4 days, about twice a week. Midweek, I cowash with my conditioner. On the weekend, I use a sulfate-free shampoo with my conditioner and follow up with a deep conditioner. I finger detangle while I have conditioner in my hair. After washing my hair,  I use a leave-in quite literally and follow up with a hair cream and oil applied in sections. Essentially, the LCO method. Recently, I find that I have to finger coil my hair otherwise it'll dry super stringy. It's tedious by my hair looks nicely defined afterwards. In the summer, I air dry. In the winter or when I am in a rush, I will diffuse. For day 2, day 3, and on rare occurrence day 4 hair, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair just slightly and use a bit of leave-in and oil on any frizzy bits. At night, I sleep with a bonnet. My hair is too short for pineapple method but when it was longer I did that.

I currently live in Asia but this method has worked for me both here and back in the US. Although, I have to clarify my hair a bit more know due to air and water quality issues. On both continents, I was living (am living) in places with hot and humid summers but my hair cooperates. 

For products, right now I am trying my hand on readily available products as to avoid paying overseas shipping so it is Aromatica for Shampoo and Conditioner, and L'Oreal Botanicals and Yves Rocher for styling products. They are okay but I definitely am missing my DevaCurl.

Whether you use the CG method or not ultimately depends on you and your hair. Again, I love the CG method but I have seen some Curlies who don't use it and their hair has flourished as well.

Winters can be brutal on our hair. I know I tend to get more dry frizz in the winter, so I like to deep condition more than once a week or my hair turns to straw. 
Try to make sure your hair is as dry as possible before going outside in freezing temps, your hair WILL FREEZE in whatever position it was in if it is wet. 
Not curly hair related, but be prepared for dry skin as well. Maybe buy a humidifier to sleep with to help mitigate dryness or you might end up with a sore throat/dry nose/ dry everything.

It's hard to tell, but underneath most of my hair near the scalp my hair is super curly, but I cannot seem to get some parts to curl/wave without braids. A better hair care routine and stopping heat has caused a lot of improvement thickness-wise from 7 years ago (pic on right), but now I would love to have the spiral-y curl I used to sport now that my hair is healthier!

106,22325,/r/curlyhair/comments/gb22b4/it_takes_ten_years_for_my_hair_to_dry/fp38rej/,"Hey! It might take ten years to read this comment! tl;dr: microfiber towel scrunching, don't plop too long, try to let your gel form a cast before bed and sleep with some airflow around your hair (more below). 

 It sounds like we have similar hair - curly, thick/dense, and not fine (my hair isn't coarse but it's not fine, either). Basically lots and lots of high porosity hair to soak up water and products. My hair is a mix of spirals and corkscrews with some waves - basically 3a with bits of 2c and 3b in terms of curl patterns. My hair takes ages to dry with product in or when bound up somehow, but if I jump in a pool on a warm day and don't shower after it will dry fast as anything after that, with all the water soluble product rinsed off and nothing else to keep moisture in. 

Over the years I've found that my best options for drying my hair that don't involve shoulder strain are: 
* Microfiber towel/turbie twist 
- don't plop for too long 
- root clip for a while before bed 
- sleep with hair up in some way that it can still move a bit (satin scarf, silk bonnet, etc).

So basically my best washes come in the evening. After cleansing and conditioning I usually: 

-rake/comb through a curl cream
-scrunch gently with bare hands to encourage clumping
-prayer hands gel over all 
-scrunch gently but thoroughly with a microfiber towel making sure that the towel is really soaked 
-scrunch in a bit more gel with my bare hands 
- plop in a different microfiber towel for 10-15 minutes (basically time to finish skincare, dry off, moisturize, and put on clean pyjamas)
- remove plop and root clip *or* just make sure to flip my hair from side to side occasionally if I don't want to be bothered with clips
- do something else for an hour or so until I go to bed 
- put my hair up either a) in a pineapple and sleep on a silk pillowcase, b)wrap up in a satin scarf so the hair is loosely piled on my head or c) plop into a loose-fitting sill bonnet, again so my hair is loosely piled on my head 
- sleep
- take down my hair in the morning and SOTC and fluff as the absolute last thing I do before starting my day. Sometimes I don't SOTC until I get to work, because my hair may still be a bit damp at the roots, but it's better than wet or heat-damaged hair, for me. 

If I don't have an overnight available, I'll do these steps but instead of sleeping I'll diffuse for a little while on low heat, high speed - I have both a bowl diffuser and a hand-shaped Devafuser. 20 minutes will get through most of it. 

I find scrunching with microfiber gets me much better curls than even the softest jersey, and it makes drying or mostly drying an actual possiblity. This routine might  seem fussy but most of it is passive time and it's not overly picky about products or specific techniques (my root clipping is haphazard, I don't do bowl methods or extensive pulsing or finger coiling etc.). 

Good luck!! I absolutely hate having wet hair, especially in the summertime when it's just like wearing a wet wool sock on your head! 😁

After loathing her curls (and straightening 1-3 times a day) she's trying the curly girl method.  One thing that has her frustrated right now is her hair is in order to get the curls to stay, she needs to use so much curl custard her hair is sticky all day. My own hair is 2b/2c, so what works for me doesn't typically work too well for her.

Below is what she sent me:

Routine and products:


Ogx coconut milk shampoo and conditioner (I know I know, I'm working to remove the silicone from my products) ;Mop top curl custard; Just started Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla spray because hair feel so dry and brittle throughout the day; Maui moisture Shea  mask/ leave in (once or twice a week)


I don't really have a routine yet that I like. 


Wash days I use the shampoo and conditioner. I just ran out of Ogx Argon oil curl cream but I use to mix that with the curl custard. Stand in the shower with hair soaked and squish with the curl cream and Moptop. I was doing this with my head flipped over but now I'm trying it to the side in an attempt to keep larger curl clumps. Flipping my head over makes my curls very stringy. I use a cotton tee shirt to dry and plop then air dry. My hair is very frizzy and dry and is often sticky. 


Refresh isn't really great at this early stage. I have to saturate my hair every morning and I apply the curl custard. If its day two it three I either just wet the custard that is in my hair from day 1 or use just a tiny bit as a ""refresh""

* “More uniform” waves/curls will most likely happen with more clumping of the curls. To achieve this effect better without having to add more products (ie gel or curl cream or whatever), after shampooing, flip your head upside down in the shower and take a crap-ton of conditioner through your hair until everything feels slick and detangled. Wrap it up in a bun on the top of your head (makeshift, without a tie or anything, just to get it out of your way and let the conditioner further absorb) and continue showering. When you are done with everything else, flip your head upside down again (I point the shower head pretty much straight down at this part so my face isn’t streaming with water), and take cupfuls of water with your hands to squish out the conditioner until it feels like a silky, watery mixture (experiment it’s the feeling here—everyone is different and their hair needs different amounts of conditioner). Stop the shower and squish excess water out with you hands while still upside down. Here, you can choose to plop, add gel/curl cream in, and then scrunch out excess moisture with a tee shirt and diffuse or scrunch out excess moisture with a tee shirt and air dry. You’ll notice that your curls will clump together more with more definition when they have conditioner holding them together. It sounds like a lot to add, but it really only adds maybe a minute to your routine in total, once you get the hang of it.

* The next thing I thought was that you should try to go further with the CGM. I had [2A waves](https://imgur.com/a/jEHBa) when I began. Now, on a bad day, my hair is [2C-ish](https://imgur.com/a/3LbtBhG) (today) and on a good day, it’s a mix of 2C/3A. Unfortunately, I don’t have any good day pictures right now because DevaCurl products kind of ruined my hair, but I’m working on getting that back.

* As for beach waves, maybe when you do all the conditioning steps and everything, at the end, just kind of take your fingers through your waves and then let them set like that? I’m not sure there. I’ve also heard of salt sprays, but I’m skeptical of those because salt can be very drying and curly/wavy hair tends to be very dry already.",3a,  hi     couple    things     and    idea    routine

114,31524,/r/curlyhair/comments/e8o47r/help_with_sleeping_and_refreshing/,"Help with sleeping and refreshingI've got thick 2B/2C wavy hair and I've been CG for over a year and a half now. I'm starting to see some real results in that when I go product free, my hair curls up naturally without any products. It's happier and healthier (albeit still quite frizzy) than ever in my whole life. But I just can't seem to get a good sleep or refresh routine down. 

My scalp is extremely sensitive since I spent my entire life with my hair in tight braids for school or a ponytail since anything else was ""vain"". But now at least 17/18 years of pulling my hair up tightly have made it such that if I sleep with my hair in a loose pineapple, I wake up with a splitting headache. I can't really put much on my hair as it leads to a headache. So I currently just sleep with my hair loose and in a gel cast since I wash at night. I sleep on a satin pillowcase.

I also can't get a good refresh down. I tried some gel and water in a spray bottle but all that accomplished was stringy and frizzy curls with some parts coated in a cast and the rest a mess. I mostly just lightly run wet hands over my hair and scrunch lightly but I'm not usually satisfied with the results. Today I tried the damp microfiber towel trick I read about on here and it seems to have worked slightly.

I think it's okay to be discouraged! Honestly, right now I'm loving the extra curl in my hair, but I know that eventually the long routines and treatments will be too much for me and I'll take my own break from it. Especially because I have to be real with myself and admit that my hair--possibly like yours--isn't so curly that I don't have any other option. I'm like a 2c/3a but my hair is fine, so it's easily rough dried on low to a softer, smoother wave.

My advice is that whenever it's too much for you, ditch the styling, so the long diffusing sesh and the crunch, but put what effort you can into avoiding silicones, sulfates except for clarifying, and alcohols.

I “wash” with water and rinse with an even mix of apple cider vinegar, aloe juice and water with a few drops of rosemary eo mixed in. The mixture acts as a detangler and moisturizes by balancing my hair’s pH. When I get out of the shower I moisturize the tips further with a tiny bit of coconut oil and air dry (I’m probably going to get a diffuser soon for a bit of extra volume)

Once a month I do a hair mask with egg yolk and olive oil.

120,29207,/r/curlyhair/comments/fwayp0/need_help_with_curl_mousse/,"Need help with curl mousseI am caucasian with type 2 hair (somewhere around a 2b/c) and I just started using Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk hair mousse about a week ago, but I think I need some help perfecting it in terms of how I want my hair to look. I’ll try to go into as much detail as possible about my hair routine. 

As soon as I get out of the shower, I flip my hair upside down and scrunch it with a cotton T-shirt. I take one full pump of the Oliology Coconut Oil Curl Cream and scrunch it into my hair, then comb it through with a wide-tooth comb. Then I take the mousse, dispense a cream-puff sized amount onto the back of my hand, rake it through a section of my hair, and scrunch the section, and I do that around my whole head. The mousse dries, creates a cast, and I wait until my hair is fully dry before I take a hair pik and fluff out my hair until my hair isn’t crunchy anymore. 

The problem arises after I fluff out my hair. My hair feels limp, dry, and it looks stringy. It curls a little bit, but not the way I know my hair can curl. it seems like my hair just clumps together. Not like the cute curl clumps. I wish I would’ve taken a picture earlier today so I can truly describe what I’m talking about. Anyways, I have to mist my hair with a spray bottle, fingercomb it through, scrunch it again, and wait until it dries and I fluff out my hair with a hair pik AGAIN for my hair to actually curl how I want it to and how I know it can curl. I feel like this is an extra unnecessary step that can be eliminated if I fix whatever i’m doing wrong in my hair routine, but I guess I can live with wetting and scrunching my hair twice. It’s not like I’m seeing anyone anytime soon anyways. 

So, from all of that, does anyone know what i’m doing wrong the first time around and how I can fix it? Any cooperation would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions that I didn’t include in this, let me know.

127,34873,/r/curlyhair/comments/f20axp/is_my_hair_texture_changing_or_is_it_just_damaged/,"Is my hair texture changing or is it just damaged?Fair warning this is long-ish, so **TL;DR: used to have 2C/3A curly hair thats disappeared, tried almost everything I can think of, nothings helping.**

I'm currently 23 and around this time last year my hair slowly started to change to a very odd, frizzy, unnaturally kinked/coarse mess. It started with one small section near my right temple and slowly became the whole crown of my head by last May and in July I lost all of the curl pattern on the top half of my hair. It's not straight at all and its not curly. Its just a coarse mess that looks extremely frizzy.

Recently I've switched my hair care products and started only shampooing my hair once a week and co-washing it 1-2 times in between shampoo and which hasn't helped either (both products are from the master list of products from this sub). The portion of my hair that still curls is responding great to this but not the top half.

A month ago I got my hair cut thinking that it was because my hair was too long and was weighing it down so I took off about 2 inches and got long layers back, and unfortunately this only took off the portion that was still curling normally and left me with more kinked/coarse hair than curl.

My mom is convinced it's hormonal and my hair is changing texture because of this, but since I'm 23 I disagree with her as this would've happened when I was 13 and going through puberty.

Recently (today, rather) I had remembered that when I was 18 and thought it was a good idea to make my hair lighter with (very) diluted hydrogen peroxide in the summer but my hair wasn't damaged after that, instead it just looked like a weird blonde. All of that has grown out now but it had me thinking that I possibly damaged the hair follicle when I did that, causing this weird mess that I have now.

I'm really hoping that its just dry and damaged because I loved my curly hair (and straightened it at most maybe once a month or for a few holidays), so if anyone has any suggestions or ideas as to whats happened with my hair it'd be SO appreciated because I miss my curls :( 

I can post photos if needed of my hair at 21 (before it turned into this) and how it is now if needed.

I see three options:   
1. Attempt to pack enough products to last the whole time, probably pay extra for the weight of my suitcase, and have no room for clothes   
2. Pack a bit of products and attempt to find substitutes in France (not likely en province, but maybe through Amazon?)

All of that means my hair gets dirty pretty much everyday, especially when you add that I live in a high humidity area. I have 2c/3a curls on a good day. 


Currently I’ve been washing as often as necessary (I try to last 2-3 days) but I have to keep using the shampoo I used for my reset wash, Herbal Essences bio-renew refresh blue ginger &amp; micellar water (using this one bc we already had it). Anyways, when I try using the devacurl low-poo, it doesn’t seem to cleanse enough no matter how long I scrub or how long I rinse it. I’m always left with residue or grease (I honestly don’t know which it is) and my hair looks and feels nasty. 

My current routine is: herbal essences shampoo, devacurl delight conditioner s2c, devacurl b’leave in, and devacurl light defining gel, clip roots, diffuse (usually) for 10 minutes, air dry, sotc. I have a sensitive scalp so I am VERY careful not to get product up there other than to cleanse.

Sorry again for the terrible lighting. Routine here:

1. Be right side up or upside down (in this photo I had been upside down to shower)

2. Shampoo/clarify with Tresemme Botanique Nourish and Replenish Shampoo (it has sulfates, but my hair feels moisturized/happy as long as I condition)

3. Condition with Tresemme Botanique Nourish and Replenish Conditioner (I wash it all out since I found out my hair can be over moisturized relatively easy now) 

4. Scrunch out water (no separation) 

5. Plop for like 10 mins to dry it off a bit

6. Scrunch in Taliah Wajiid’s The Great Detangler Leave-In and L.A. Looks Gel

7. Plop again for like 30 mins and let gel cast harden 

8. Scrunch out gel cast


Any recommendations? 

**Edit:**

- Natural 2a &amp; 2b in the back, 2c &amp; 3a in the front. Bottom layer has traditionally been a 1c or 2a. Responds well to LA Looks Sports Gel and becomes more of a 2a/2b

- Mid back length. I got layers a while back but not from a curly stylist (*cries*)

- Medium-High(ish) porosity? My hair dries in like an hour and a half if I just leave it alone. It also really seems to not mind protein all that much. 

- fine/medium diameter, sparse distribution (I can see my scalp pretty easy)

- I did deep condition my hair recently which over-moisturized it (but I shampooed it with a strongish sulfate (mentioned above) to counteract this and it seemed to work) 

- I’ve been using Neutral Protein Filler and scrunching it into my hair every now and then. Doesn’t seem to do a lot? It doesn’t make my hair hard or easily broken or much of anything to be honest. 

- May have been curlier/clumped at the top as a young teenager, but I developed PCOS and a lot of it fell out. Also, I take birth control pills now. At that point in my life, I only had access to shampoo, no conditioner. 

- Half Vietnamese, half (white) American. My dad had/has 3b curls and my mom (and grandparents) has some barely-there 1c/2a waves. I got literally everything in between 1c and 3b lol

So, now I have really lovely waves (somewhere between 2a/2b) with not a lot of volume at the roots and less so now because the highlights have grown out and there is a significant amount of regrowth. However the bleached hair is curly / wavy.

Is my hair curly/ wavy just because it's bleached fried or have I got some natural volume to my hair? How will I know without growing all the bleached highlights out (which may take years).

And I'm a 2a/2b wavy for reference, so virtually anything has the potential to weigh my hair down lol.

The only reason I'm not using it now is that I got another mask to try out.

158,31865,/r/curlyhair/comments/f36o4z/my_hair_isnt_curly_now/,"My hair isn't curly now?For the longest time, I had big, bushy 2c/3a ringlets. I started using the CG method a few years ago, and I achieved some super cute, pixie-length curls. The volume and definition was, in a word, divine. Loved it, very happy.

Recently, I decide I miss my long hippie-hair, after several years of pixie-cuts. Growing out a really short hair style is an awkward process, as many of you may know. So I brace myself for a couple months of bad hair days. I'm prepared to execute an array of hobby pins, scarves and hair clips as needed.
 What I'm not prepared for is that my hair just... Isn't curling suddenly. Its still shirt, but long enough to tuck behind my ears. But she won't curl up captain. She's drying out a wavy 2a, at best. Neither gel, mousse or any other tricks are helping. Plopping leaves me with some voluminous helmet hair, but no spirals. Gently scrunching it with product? Nothing.

I haven't changed my routine. I use a low-sulfate shampoo once a week, a plain coconut Suave conditioner, and a lightweight leave-in, maybe some LA looks gel when I'm feeling extra. Air-dry because  I'm too lazy to diffuse. 

Am I losing it? I'm confused, and weirdly hurt and betrayed. Am I missing something?

So I have 3b/3c hair and I don’t know what to do with it. I don’t have heat damage as I hardly use heat and the last time I even used heat was 3 years ago. Despite this, my hair is always frizzy and my curls never look defined. As well as this, my hair never grows and has been the same length for the past 4 years. My hair never ‘goes down’ to my shoulder and always faces ‘upwards’ if that makes sense.
I starting to really hate my hair and have a strong urge to straighten it. It would make my life so much easier. 
My current routine is:
I wash my hair once a week with Shea Moisture Jamaican castor oil shampoo and I sometimes wash my hair with a dandruff shampoo due to my dry scalp. My hair is always itchy. I then use the Maui moisture curl quench and coconut conditioner and follow that with Shea moisture super fruit complex 10 in 1 masque to deep condition my hair.
After I wash my hair, I put on Shea moisture Jamaican castor oil leave-in conditioner followed with the Shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie and its gel. I sometimes use jojoba oil along side it.
I am allergic to coconut oil and I find that all these products just sit on my hair and it never gets absorbed.
Even have I air dry my hair, my curls are not defined. I just look like a frizzy mess. 

I would appreciate any advice!

I have a lot of sensitive skin/allergy problems, so a lot of hair products (and other things, haha) give me issues. I find I have the best luck with organic products in terms of skin reactions, but I have a hard time finding products that make my hair look good.

I have 2c/3a, low-porosity hair. In terms of how my hair looked, I had decent results with the Tresemme conditioner recommended in this sub. As an example of something that didn't work at all, Shea Moisture made me look like a ratty greaseball. So that's kind of what I'm working with!

My current routine is washing once a week with Burt's Bees More Moisture Baobab shampoo, then conditioning with the same line. I use Devacurl One Condition as a leave-in (not organic, but seems okay because I apply it outside the shower and it doesn't get a chance to run all over my body). Sometimes I plop, but not always. I never brush my hair and I always let it air dry. This routine is working okay,  but it's not amazing.

175,1612,/r/curlyhair/comments/buid1o/a_little_hair_before_and_after_a_discouraging/epcqfv3/,"Ok so taken about 1 year apart, I hardly ever wore my hair natural because it was just blah, it was frizzy, I had to use a ton of silicone based product to smooth it out and then it was just too heavy to be wavy.

I've been slowly making the switch to the CG method, I think this is where it turns into a discouraging vent:
My hair is long and just doesn't curl very well, and to be honest I just don't want to spend my life around my hair to only end up with this result. Don't get me wrong im super pleased with how my hair is now, I like that I can actually leave the house with it natural, but the insane amount of time and money spent to only get a little wavy, and still have so many issues, is just sooooo discouraging. I don't want to completely give up on the CG method, but I do need some help finding some European brands to try. I'm from California but living in Greece for the summer, so any Greek wavies help me out? I'm running low on pretty much everything and I don't know if I should give up CG or hunt for products 

I (think) I'm a 2B on top, and there is about an inch all around my hairline that is 2A and just does not want to wave, it's just lifeless.

Routine: 
Wash almost everyday- on days I go wavy I can only do 2nd day hair in a pony or a bun, because no matter what it's a knotted shit show in the morning. I also *try* to work out every day and I sweat so much that there is just no way I'm not washing it.

Shampoo and condition: Shea Moisture Fruit Fusion- I like that my hair feels pretty soft after and detangles easily

All of my styling products I put on pretty wet hair, I section the top from the bottom, and comb everything through to evenly distribute it, and then scrunch everything with a microfiber, sometimes I plop sometimes I dont.

Devacurl Decadence Leave-In- not bad, again I like that it detangles easily but not the biggest fan of Devacurl looking to ditch this when its empty

Cantu Curl Activator- I *almost* gave up CG until I found this. I love the way it feels in my hair, I get nice waves, much more controlled frizz and my hair still feels soft and ""touchable"" 

Devacurl Arc Angel- I like it, I like that it doesnt get flakey on me 

I usually just air dry it, I have a diffuser but i haven't seen anything noticeable in the way it looks so I usually go the lazy route.

176,26727,/r/curlyhair/comments/goa0t6/okay_im_very_confused_new_to_cgm_and_have_some/,"Okay I'm very confused. New to CGM and have some questions.I have had an ongoing battle with my frizzy wavy 2a/2b with some 2c strands since as long as I can remember. I was washing with sulfates and whatever I could pick up that was cheap and straightening my hair so I didn't have to deal with my waves in the all year round humid weather where I live. Only about two years and a half ago did I discover that I needed to stop using sulfates. I stopped that altogether and started using devacurl products, when those got too expensive I moved on to others like all about curls and shea moisture.

So here are my issues. I need to incorporate a purple shampoo into my routine and my hair is currently feeling like straw which leads me to believe I have protein overload from using so many hydrating and high protein products. At first I thought the straw like and frizzy feel was due to the hair bleaching, but my hairdresser says it is likely protein overload. So my questions are:

how do I incorporate the purple shampoo into my routine? Do I just use it when I shampoo once a week and cowash with my conditioner on the other days?

How do people regulate their protein levels? Do you just have different lines of products in your cabinet, like one line for when you need protein and another for when you have protein overload? It seems like that's what I need because of how sensitive my hair is to protein levels

When I looked into protein overload, people say to use a deep conditioner. Well, I have one in my cabinet, it's the devacurl deep sea repair l, but I now have been told that it is all protein. So how do I know which deep conditioners have protein and which do not when they are all deep conditioners?


For now I am planning on buying a clarifying shampoo and switching to moisturizing only products like the not your mothers Tahitian gardinia as that was what was recommended to me. Does anyone know what else I can do for protein overload?",2a,  okay    i m    confused     new    cgm    questions i    ongoing    battle    frizzy    wavy    2a 2b    2c    strands    since    long    remember     washing    sulfates    whatever    could    pick    cheap    straightening    hair    deal    waves    year    round    humid    weather    live     two    years    half    ago    discover    needed    stop    using    sulfates     stopped    altogether    started    using    devacurl    products     got    expensive    moved    others    like    curls    shea    moisture     issues     need    incorporate    purple    shampoo    routine    hair    currently    feeling    like    straw    leads    believe    protein    overload    using    many    hydrating    high    protein    products     first    thought    straw    like    frizzy    feel    due    hair    bleaching     hairdresser    says    likely    protein    overload     questions    are     incorporate    purple    shampoo    routine     use    shampoo    week    cowash    conditioner    days     people    regulate    protein    levels     different    lines    products    cabinet     like    one    line    need    protein    another    protein    overload     seems    like    that s    need    sensitive    hair    protein    levels    looked    protein    overload     people    say    use    deep    conditioner     well     one    cabinet     devacurl    deep    sea    repair    l     told    protein     know    deep    conditioners    protein    deep    conditioners     planning    buying    clarifying    shampoo    switching    moisturizing    products    like    mothers    tahitian    gardinia    recommended    me     anyone    know    else    protein    overload   ,okay i m confused new cgm question i ongoing battle frizzy wavy 2a 2b 2c strand since long remember washing sulfate whatever could pick cheap straightening hair deal wave year round humid weather live two year half ago discover needed stop using sulfate stopped altogether started using devacurl product got expensive moved others like curl shea moisture issue need incorporate purple shampoo routine hair currently feeling like straw lead believe protein overload using many hydrating high protein product first thought straw like frizzy feel due hair bleaching hairdresser say likely protein overload question are incorporate purple shampoo routine use shampoo week cowash conditioner day people regulate protein level different line product cabinet like one line need protein another protein overload seems like that s need sensitive hair protein level looked protein overload people say use deep conditioner well one cabinet devacurl deep sea repair l told protein know deep conditioner protein deep conditioner planning buying clarifying shampoo switching moisturizing product like mother tahitian gardinia recommended me anyone know else protein overload,okay confused new cgm question ongoing battle frizzy wavy 2a 2b 2c strand since long remember washing sulfate whatever could pick cheap straightening hair deal wave year round humid weather live two year half ago discover needed stop using sulfate stopped altogether started using devacurl product got expensive moved others like curl shea moisture issue need incorporate purple shampoo routine hair currently feeling like straw lead believe protein overload using many hydrating high protein product first thought straw like frizzy feel due hair bleaching hairdresser say likely protein overload question incorporate purple shampoo routine use shampoo week cowash conditioner day people regulate protein level different line product cabinet like one line need protein another protein overload seems like need sensitive hair protein level looked protein overload people say use deep conditioner well one cabinet devacurl deep sea repair l told protein know deep conditioner protein deep conditioner planning buying clarifying shampoo switching moisturizing product like mother tahitian gardinia recommended anyone know else protein overload

You should only be using that V05 shampoo once to get rid of any silicones in your hair. After that, you should rarely use a sulfate shampoo. (I’ve gone years without one.)

The number one rule of Curly Girl is no sulfate shampoos. You should be washing with a sulfate-free shampoo or using a co-wash, instead. Some wavies use a sulfate shampoo once a month for buildup, but I avoid them entirely. 

That Shea Moisture Curl and Shine conditioner was WAY too heavy for my 2b hair. I used it twice and it left my hair heavy, frizzy, and limp. I would replace it ASAP.  

You should do another wash with the V05 to clarify that Shea Moisture our of your hair, then stash that bottle in the back of the cabinet and change to the co-wash or sulfate-free shampoo. Some people use a combination of co-washing some days and using a sulfate-free shampoo other days.

183,34658,/r/curlyhair/comments/eiuwa1/kinky_curly_curling_custard_tips/,"Kinky Curly Curling Custard tips?I've been struggling to get the custard to work on my hair and I'm wondering if anyone has any tips? I love the Knot Today leave in, it's a staple in my routine, so I saved up to buy the curling custard because it's a bit more expensive than I'm used to spending but I had high hopes because of how well knot today works for me. After a month or so of useage I'm honestly pretty disappointed. Idk if I'm using it wrong or what.

My current routine (2c/3a, low porosity, thin) 
-wash with Shea moisture manuka honey &amp; yogurt hydrate + repair shampoo
-squish to condish with Garnier whole blends honey treasures conditioner and leave in for a few minutes
-rinse out 50% and leave hair soaking wet
-rake in kinky curly knot today (only if extra moisture is needed)
-scrunch in a small amount of kinky curly curling custard to just the ends of my hair
-plop for 10-20 minutes then air dry

What I find is that the second the custard touches my hair it looks fine but feels very dry and stiff and kind of straw like, despite all the conditioner and water left on my hair. If I don't use it my hair stays feeling soft and moisturized but it tends to frizz up and lose shape *very* easily. I once tried mixing the custard and knot today together before applying which helped counteract the dry straw like feeling but then left me with weird white chunks in my hair. Does anyone have tricks that they've used to make it work better for them? Maybe a different thing I can try mixing it with?

Been doing curly girl method for about 6 weeks. 

My routine so far is:
Wash with Eden cowash or Live clean shampoo Argan oil. Wash about every 3 days, alternating these. 
Condition with tresemme botanique conditioner. Rinse with head upside down. I don’t really do S2C, I find my hair gets too weighed down. 
Scrunch in Cantu curl cream for kids and Dippity do girls with curls gel. I used to do praying hands but my curls are happier when I just scrunch in from the bottom. 
Plop for 20 min then air dry, sometimes diffuse but definition gets lost. 
I have lovely ringlets when wet, much less so when dry. 
Clarify once a week or once every 2 weeks. 

Had a deva cut the other day, looks worse now. I feel like I wasn’t curly enough, the hair dresser made me feel foolish for getting one. Maybe not meant for 2b/c curls, I dunno...

187,34141,/r/curlyhair/comments/cuzt2h/updos_constantly_frizzy/,"Updos constantly frizzyI’ve been doing CG for a few months and I feel like I’m still working out a fair amount of the kinks (no pun intended). My hair type is somewhere between 2b-3a depending on the day and the section of my hair. I try not to touch my hair once it is dry because it worsens the frizziness. 

I typically have to wear my hair up for work and I have a wedding to go to next weekend and I think I’d like to wear my hair up (typically I’d straighten it for a special event but I’m trying to avoid doing that). 

Every time I put my hair up it gets crazy frizzy and it looks super messy. Idk if I’m pulling my curls too tightly or not tight enough, or maybe it’s just my touching my curls with my bare hands that contributes or what it is. Sometimes I’ll even have a little wisp of hair almost like a tiny curl starting that stand straight up. Idk if the messiness is from the color of my hair (darkish brown) and the fact that you can’t differentiate parts as easily as with lighter hair or what is happening. The only way I’ve known to get clean updos is to blow dry straightish or iron my hair first. I can sometimes get away with a semi-messy up style at work but not always and not for a wedding

I am starting the CG routine up again after taking a long break where I was straightening. Previously I had a short bob and my hair clumped decently well, but now that my hair is longer I'm finding that it's not clumping and plopping has been useless - when I take my hair out of the tee shirt it's stuck all over my head in weird directions and the curls have split apart so I end up having to rewet it all over again. If I diffuse, that also splits up the curls. Does plopping just not work for me? Could I be doing something wrong? My hair doesn't have layers currently so I don't know if that could be affecting it as well. 

Routine - shampoo with Aveeno Pure Renewal shampoo, S2C with Tresemme Nourish &amp; Replenish conditioner, try to maintain clumps, then I scrunch in a kumquat-to-golf ball size amount of KCCC while hair is sopping and plop with a long sleeve tee shirt.

201,26335,/r/curlyhair/comments/f4huno/top_half_of_hair_help/,"Top half of hair help??Hi! So I started the CGM in November and it’s been great for my hair, the only thing is the proper curls only start partway down my hair! The rest starts off curly but very quickly gets pulled to a sad vaguely wavy state. It’s like a 2C at the bottom and 2A at the top. 

I think this because of pony tails &amp; buns that pull my hair tight. I thought maybe my hair was changing, but it seems to be changing at the length it’s pulled into the bun. Unfortunately my job requires my hair up, under a hat. 

Not only that, but putting my hair up is super easy for when I need to get it out of the way. Hmmmm. 

I’ve started putting my hair up to sleep using multiple (2 lol) loose ponytails for pineappling, but are there and tips and tricks to put some volume and wave back into the top part of my hair, and to get it to stop breaking away so much from its curl pattern?

211,11650,/r/curlyhair/comments/cpuzcc/does_henna_loosen_curl_pattern/ewsgqyt/,"I have fine, 2C/3A curls. Henna did loosen my curl pattern over time (after 6-12 months of treatment every 2-3 weeks) but doing dye release with amla successfully reversed and prevents that. I also only color the roots now, sobut isn't getting overloaded.. I've read that amla darkens the henna, but I think it is subtle. It will still be a shade of red/auburn. I'm not sure though because I do the 2-step henndigo for black color. You can try an amla only treatment but it may darken also.

Don't waste your money on the Henna Sooq Red Raj. I have tried all of Hennasooq's henna as well as several henna from other suppliers. That Red Raj is the only one I have ever used that ever faded on my hair. I think it is cheap henna adulterated with a skin safe demi-permanent dye. And she promotes it as premium! I swear for a while I thought she was a crook, but Henna sooq's regular rajasthani performs as good as the best of them.

What usually ends up happening is that my normally low-maintenance, fairly curly hair becomes a greasy, heavy mess at the roots. Crazily enough, the thing that makes my hair perform the absolute best is Pantene Two-in-One shampoo/conditioner.

(Fine, lightly color treated, very thick hair, medium porosity, 2c-3b if that helps).

224,2418,/r/curlyhair/comments/eyfh2s/devacurl_issues_megathread/fgmwsup/,"I have very fine yet thick hair. I wash it every 1-2 days, less in the winter and more in the summer, because it shows oil very easily and it starts to clump as soon as it gets dirty. 

My hair framing the left side of my face is 2a, while the hair framing the right side is 2c, which is kind of annoying, so I’m constantly trying different techniques and products in an effort to even things out. In the summer of 2018 I decided to give DevaCurl a try, so I bought the Low-Poo Original and the One Condition. 

About a third of the way through the bottle I started to notice that my hair felt sticky, and that it would look clumpy and dirty even when freshly washed. I looked to the internet for advice, and decided that I probably wasn’t doing a good enough job thoroughly rinsing all of the product out. I continued with the DC products, being extra aware of my rinsing technique, but the sticky, clumpy hair did not get better. And now I was having problems with dandruff. Big yellow flakes!

So enough was enough. I figured that I just wasn’t using the DC products correctly, and if they were that fussy then they weren’t the correct products for me.

I have recently started caring for my wavy/curly hair and have a few questions. 

[ps. I live in a country where salons &amp; products catered for curly hair are non-existent / limited :( ]

My hair has many curl patterns that flows to my chest. The curls usually start at the midsection, so my roots to the midsection are straight and flat. 

The bottom layers, too, are basically straight/2a hair.

My top layers ranges from 2b-3a curl types (again starting from the midsection)


So my questions are:

1- tips for volumizing the roots? - i have tried using a diffuser (multiple brands &amp; types) it just frizzes up my hair.

2- can my bottom layers further curl?

3- I’m planning to get bangs professionally cut (but not by a curly hair expert). The cut would be where my curls start to form, would this mean i won’t have curly bangs? (because again the roots to midsection is flat and straight) 


—————————————————————————

I currently use Cantu cleansing shampoo and hydrating conditioner. Shea Moisture curl enhancing smoothie. Previously, Devacurl gel but since the drama around the brand, I started making my own flaxseed gel (which I love!)

I let it air dry, since diffusers have not been kind to me :(

However, I felt that the Deva Curl products were too light for my dense hair. Even with the highest strength gel, my hair would flop within minutes of styling. I recently switched back to drugstore and my hair likes it. 

Not too sure about my hair type. I think my hair is somewhere from 2c to 3a. I did a porosity test and believe mine is normal to high, but I’d have to do another one to make sure. 

Routine:
-Wash every 3 or so days with any sort of low-poo product (like Lovely Curls light lathering shampoo)
-Condition with V05 non silicone conditioner 
-Leave a little conditioner in.
-After shower, apply Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Mousse all over with praying hands method, plus s2c
-Apply LA looks extreme sport gel with praying hands, focusing more on my ends. S2c that as well.

240,16975,/r/curlyhair/comments/c887av/three_different_hair_types/esmt0hk/,"My hair sounds similar, I have more 2c/3a on the top, the middle is 3a-3b and the nape and edges are 3b-3c. All of my hair got curlier, softer and smoother when I cut almost all oils and butters from my products. The products I use with oils (Giovanni shampoo, conditioner, leave-in) have a light oil (sunflower) towards the middle of the ingredient list. I also use the VO5 Extra Body and Kiwi Lime conditioners. I can use heavier (Shea Moisture coconut rehydration mask) deep conditioners and be ok, and use the shampoo and conditioner from the same line more in the winter to protect my hair from the dry, cold air. 

I can't co-wash either. Not routinely or regularly at least. When I just need to rinse sweat and pollen from my hair, once a week in the summer it's ok with a light conditioner (Giovanni Direct Leave-in), but otherwise, it's just a disaster.

I also can't leave any regular conditioner in my hair as a leave-in. It looks heavy and weighed down and feels gross. Sometimes, I use my leave-in conditioners as a rinse out if my hair doesn't feel particularly dry.

I have to clarify my hair 1-2x/month to remove hard water buildup. That can also weigh down my hair, make it frizzy for no reason, and give a rough feeling to my hair. I have predominately calcium and magnesium deposits in my water.

For frizz, I tend to add more leave-in conditioner that i emulsify in my hands with some warm water and kind of glaze over my hair. If I have a curl that just totally loses shape, I will wet it with my hands, add some more leave-in and maybe some gel if I used it, and rescrunch that one piece. I do the same if I get a knot or tangle, work through it with water and a light leave-in, rescrunch and let it dry.

Adding more layers on top can also help the hair curl more. I get long layers put in twice a year with my trims and it definitely helps things curl up more on the top layer.

243,32979,/r/curlyhair/comments/9su6dl/advice_on_gel_use_and_dry_hair/,"Advice on gel use and dry hairHi,

I have pretty course, highly porous hair. I have been using CGM for a month, and while I have great curl definition and better 2nd and 3rd day hair than I have in years (used to have 3a hair), I can't seem to get the texture to not feel like straw. I have tried some leave in products, but they build up on my hair quickly. If I use leave in conditioners or oils, my hair feels gross and like I just put grease over dry hair. If I don't use leave in conditioners, my hair frizzes and feels like hay. Either way it LOOKS like I have product in my hair. My hair is naturally blonde. Obviously, my routine changed when my curl pattern changed, but my hair feels god-awful. 

Routine: I use a Deva low-poo once a week and Paul Mitchell shampoo 2 clarifying once-twice a month (depending on if I need it). (I have hard water and my landlord doesn't allow us to tamper with the faucets, so a softener is out of the question.) I then s2c a Deva conditioner and rinse it mostly out (it makes my hair cakey if I leave much in). While still upside down I apply a pump or two of argan oil, a pump of Shea Moisture Leave in conditioner only on the ends, and plop. It takes my hair forever to even get to damp level, so I plop for 15 minutes (it's still pretty wet) and add another small pump of the shea moisture leave in conditioner. Add small clips all over to kind of faux scrunch and diffuse until damp. Then I take out clips, add a LOT of DevaCurl Ultra gel to damp hair (if I add it when it's any wetter, it's like I didn't put any in there at all). Then diffuse to 90% and air dry the rest. Scrunch out the crunch. 

TL;DR: The curl pattern looks great with this routine, my hair doesn't look that caked up anymore, but it now FEELS AWFUL. It still feels so dry and kind of matted even though it doesn't really look like it. Is this normal? Because I can't stand to touch it.

244,13854,/r/curlyhair/comments/gd4amx/im_so_confused/fpheowh/,"I have 2a-2c hair and have straight hair when using silicon-containing products, especially when there is low humidity. I think some people just have hair that is more malleable. In the past, if you used a curling iron, did your hair hold the curl (with hairspray or whatever) or did it fall easily no matter what you did? People who actually do have straight hair often can't get any hold from a curling iron while people who have wavy/curly hair that often can look straight because of silicones do get good results with a curling iron.

 So, with silicones (and drying sulfate conditioners) your hair may look straight but when following CGM and staying away from silicones (even the CGM-approved water soluble ones) your hair may start to wave/curl, especially when there's more humidity in the air. This is how my hair works and I think it's great because it means that I can have waves/curls sometimes and straighter hair sometimes. I can still even have a blow-out look following CGM methods by altering my routine and just using leave in and then putting my dry hair up in a satin scrunchie in a bun to get big, blown-out looking waves. 

But, if you want your hair to be more stick straight, you can also go back to using silicones and blow drying, etc. There's nothing really wrong with it and it is your hair :).  For my hair though I get split ends much faster when using silicones and sulfate shampoos than when following CGM.

My current routine involves cowashing with the standard Tresemme conditioner. After my shower, I squish water out of my hair with a shirt and use the praying hands method to apply LA sports gel; then I scrunch the gel in until my hands are on fire. Plop for an hour, let it airdry, then I throw it up in a pineapple without SOTC (although this doesn't seem to work, so I'll be changing that. I also just bought my first diffuser!!) Sometimes I'll use a few other products before gel, like Bella Curls Curl Defining Creme or Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I deep condition once every week or two with Shea Moisture Coconut Oil.

1. My hair naturally parts further over to the right, so I have a ton of hair over to the right and not a lot on the left. Consequently, my right is fairly well defined and voluminous, but my left side is lacking. My left side is more like waves. I also tend to sleep on my left side, which really doesn't seem to help. What can I do to help my left side live up to the right without having to change my part?
2. How does one know when to clarify? I'm having a hard time determining it.
3. On day 2-3, my curls are pretty much waves - which I'm fine with - but the frizz is horrible. Some parts even look totally straight! How can I help redefine my waves/curls? I have a spray bottle and numerous products at my disposal :)

2. My curls are getting nice but they seem to separate into thin spaghetti like tendrils instead of the bigger thicker clumps I see in pics and vids. Is this my fine hair, a product issue, a technique issue, or any/all?

I have (not a ton of) fine, low porosity mostly virgin 2b/2c hair with random 3a ringlets thrown in because why not? 3 weeks in to serious CG with products I feel are on a better track for me, but have been lurking/reading/messing around with only CG approved stuff and not straightening my hair for 6ish months.

As I Am Coco cowash 
(Shea Moisture moisture retention shampoo once/week)
Tresemme boutanique or Shea Moisture jamaican black castor oil cond
Wide tooth comb or finger comb while conditioned
Rinse at base of scalp (upside down) while squishing
Squish dry with tshirt
Plop with different tshirt, no product 
American Crew light hold styling gel
Air dry
Crunch scrunch

I do the entire routine upside down until undoing my plop.

Clarify about once a month but have yet to incorporate a deep conditioner to follow. (Recommendations?)

Be cautious on heat setting and how long you hold diffuser in place you don't want the metal in the strainer to get too hot and burn your hair, I've never had that happen but would think it could. 
I start at the back roots, while rest of my hair is plopping in the strainer then work my way to the ends, I don't dry my ends 100% just enough that a gel cast is in place. I don't have 45 mins to dry my hair.

I'm sort of new to this hair stuff and actually need a lot of advice cause I tried researching about moisturizers and different stuff like how their use, and it's to no use. All the information I know which I practice is the loc method whereas after I shower I apply a leave in, an oil, and the cream I sent in the post.   


I have no idea what to use to moisturize my hair with everyday to go to school but you have answered a question I have been wondering for a long time \*not to wash my hair at night. Remember I said I'll be using Shea Moisture when the quarantine is over so can you recommend products for me.

Uhhhh it's kinda all over the place right now as I try to find what works for me but right now. To reiterate I have a combination of 2B/2C/3A hair (top to bottom layers) and what I did today (clarifying day) is:   


\- Last night oiled my scalp well with Shea Moisture reparative serum and some peppermint oil, massaged well and used a boar bristle brush to run it through my hair. Then put my hair up in a loose pinapple so it would stay in the bonnet while I slept so I wouldn't get oil on my pillow 

  
\-Suave daily clarifying shampoo start from the temples massage the top and back of the head do the crown last 

  
\- Rinse thoroughly, get freaked out by the squeaking sensation after being so used to not feeling it

  
\- Shea Moisture Argan Oil and Almond Milk shampoo mixed with the last little bit of Curls Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask

  
\- Let that shit sit for 10-15 minutes while doing the rest of my shower, I wasn't in the mood to deep condition and have to get in the shower all over again (no detachable shower head :() 

  
\- Rinse with my head upside down under the water, cupping my palms and letting the conditioner water run into them, then squishing that liquid back into my hair all throughout my head. Repeat until the water is clear or mostly clear. 

  
\- Squish a good bit of the remaining water out 

  
\- Prayer hand Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus curl cream

[Don't know how to turn the picture on here. ](https://i.redd.it/1w2x8e1k0ze21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/r09gmcmn0ze21.jpg

I just started CG kind if...well only dipping my toe in. I bought some product, but only cheap ones and not the ones recommended as I didn't see that until after I bought stuff. I won't bother to list the products as they're probably not what anyone would recommend or know the brand to anyways. But to sum up. I deep conditioned my dry, fine hair. Put a mousse on the roots, praying hands gelled (light hold) my hair with it over my head. Squished the gel in. Squished the water out. Used a t-shirt to squish more water out. Plopped for...half hour or so. Then let it air dry with a little leave-in conditioner and once dry, SotC. 

I think for my first attempt it came out pretty great. Though I'm not used to how much volume I suddenly have. Second picture after two/three days I washed it and started again. Did the same routine but the hair didn't come out quite as nice. The second picture is me today on my second day curls after I woke up, wet my hair a little with leave in conditioner spray and scrunched in some foamy mousse. I like how it turned out for second day hair. 

I guess I write all this to ask...I'm still not sure what my hair type is though. The parts by my ears are a full curl that corkscrew. Which I thought was like a 3a. But then most of my hair is more 2b I think? The underside and back tend to be either almost straight or very little wave, more 2a. So I don't know if I should just stick with what I'm doing with my crappier gel and stuff because this is as good as I can hope for? Or if I actually spent the money to get the CG recommended products, if I would get less frizz and softer, more defined curls (especially on the second day). But maybe I'm hoping for too much when it comes to curls and I should just stick to waves? 

But on the third day, though my hair isn't greasy or in need of a wash really, it just gets to frizzy I have to cave and brush it all out so it's just waves. It still looks okay I guess. I don't have a picture of that though. 

Any advise I guess? My hair is colored darker brown so so bleach. I already use sulfate free/paraben free shampoo and conditioner so I don't think I have to clarify because I didn't use other products in my hair besides a heat spray? I don't know about silicone content. I've tried using less shampoo and more conditioner and that's helped, but not a ton. My hair seems to start to dry halfway through even putting mousse at the roots after having just had it under water so I don't know. I'm getting a haircut today so hopefully the dead ends I got going on being gone will help the curls stay?

1. Too much product is likely to make your hair greasy and buildup quicker, especially if your hair is low porosity or fine. It won't damage your hair though. If your hair is really dry, use both a leave-in and a curl cream. If it's not, you can use a curl cream alone. Most, if not all, curl creams are water based and will moisturize the hair. The SheaMoisture curl enhancing smoothie is a moisturizer on its own. Over time, I've simplified my routine to cleanser, conditioner, leave-in, and gel for wash and gos. After it's dried, I use a light oil and praying hands method to remove crunch. On days when I do protective styles, I'll do LCO method (leave-in, cream, oil).

2. The best way to grow your hair faster is to take care of it. Growth rate is determined by genetics, but most people struggle with maintaining the hair and it results in breakage, especially at the ends. Deep condition regularly, protect your hair ends and scalp massages. Scalp massages help with bringing blood flow to the scalp and helps with nutrient uptake of the follicles.",3b,  hair    little    bit    looser     3b 3c      woc    coarser    textured    hair     first    all     careful    ecostyler    leave ins     ecostyler    rarely    plays    nice    tends    leave    flakes     1     much    product    likely    make    hair    greasy    buildup    quicker     especially    hair    low    porosity    fine     damage    hair    though     hair    really    dry     use    leave in    curl    cream     not     use    curl    cream    alone     most     all     curl    creams    water    based    moisturize    hair     sheamoisture    curl    enhancing    smoothie    moisturizer    own     time     i ve    simplified    routine    cleanser     conditioner     leave in     gel    wash    gos     dried     use    light    oil    praying    hands    method    remove    crunch     days    protective    styles     i ll    lco    method     leave in     cream     oil      2     best    way    grow    hair    faster    take    care    it     growth    rate    determined    genetics     people    struggle    maintaining    hair    results    breakage     especially    ends     deep    condition    regularly     protect    hair    ends    scalp    massages     scalp    massages    help    bringing    blood    flow    scalp    helps    nutrient    uptake    follicles   ,hair little bit looser 3b 3c woc coarser textured hair first all careful ecostyler leave in ecostyler rarely play nice tends leave flake 1 much product likely make hair greasy buildup quicker especially hair low porosity fine damage hair though hair really dry use leave in curl cream not use curl cream alone most all curl cream water based moisturize hair sheamoisture curl enhancing smoothie moisturizer own time i ve simplified routine cleanser conditioner leave in gel wash go dried use light oil praying hand method remove crunch day protective style i ll lco method leave in cream oil 2 best way grow hair faster take care it growth rate determined genetics people struggle maintaining hair result breakage especially end deep condition regularly protect hair end scalp massage scalp massage help bringing blood flow scalp help nutrient uptake follicle,hair little bit looser 3b 3c woc coarser textured hair first careful ecostyler leave ecostyler rarely play nice tends leave flake 1 much product likely make hair greasy buildup quicker especially hair low porosity fine damage hair though hair really dry use leave curl cream use curl cream alone curl cream water based moisturize hair sheamoisture curl enhancing smoothie moisturizer time simplified routine cleanser conditioner leave gel wash go dried use light oil praying hand method remove crunch day protective style lco method leave cream oil 2 best way grow hair faster take care growth rate determined genetics people struggle maintaining hair result breakage especially end deep condition regularly protect hair end scalp massage scalp massage help bringing blood flow scalp help nutrient uptake follicle

302,27213,/r/curlyhair/comments/a4qo0n/1_month_in_lackluster_results_what_else_can_i_try/,"1 month in... lackluster results!! What else can I try?!Hi everyone!! My hair is fine (but I have a lot of it) 2a on top and 2b underneath, medium low porosity, shoulder length. Before I started CG my hair was straight in the front and on top. When I was young (like middle school) I had beautiful 2C curls. I’m wondering if I can ever get them back. 

Current routine: 

I apply all products in the shower upside down. I shampoo every other wash using Not Your Mothers Naturals (the pink one). Then I condition with the Tresemme Botanique. I put a bunch in, let it sit for ~2 min, S2C, then add more. Then I detangle using a wide tooth comb, S2C again, and scrunch wet hair with a cotton shirt to remove excess water and conditioner. I apply LA looks gel (quarter sized amounts to different sections of hair, totaling to about a fig size) using prayer hands. Plop for 15 mins, diffuse until ~50% dry. Air dry the rest and SOTC. I sleep with my hair plopped in a cotton T-shirt. 

Issues I’m having:

My hair feels waxy after SOTC. It never feels like soft and bouncy curls. 

I get some pretty nice clumps in the shower after S2C and detangling, but they go away as soon as my hair is anything but soaking wet. I have no idea how to preserve them, because my curl pattern when dry is very stringy. 

I have NO volume. I’m hoping to get a hair cut this month to maybe help this. 

Things I’ve tried:
-applying gel as demonstrated by Powerdomi (pulsing gel in two clumps). No obvious difference in results. 
-applying gel at different stages of wetness (sopping wet, lightly damp, etc). No matter what, my hair is waxy after SOTC. 
-I’ve tried protein treatments, as my hair is very limp. I tried both the Hask keratin protein mask and a rice water rinse. Neither made an obvious difference in my hair (if anything they made it MORE stringy and limp). 

I’m just about at the end of my bottle of Tresemme conditioner, so I’m looking for product recommendations to replace that. I also would love some recommendations for gel to replace the LA looks. I tried the Herbal Essences mixed berry mousse, but it doesn’t have enough hold. I also tried Kinky Curly curling custard but it doesn’t have enough hold and makes my hair waxy like the LA looks gel.

Try this:
Wash with As I Am Coconut Co-wash. While still in the shower, use a deep conditioner of choice. I like Crece Pelo, but Shea Moisture makes great ones you can but in pouches. Just choose one of the moisturizing ones. Once you let it sit for the prescribed time, rinse it out and put in a good squirt of As I Am Leave In.

Now the styling part is important. Your hair must be WET. You want it to clump when you rake it with your fingers or use a brush. I just tried the Cantu Coconut Curling Cream yesterday (my mom has been raving about it) and I really liked it, but Supercream from DevaCurl is my fave. But honestly, you should even have a decent turn out from Curl Enhancing Smoothie (but be light handed with it if you use the Smoothie, it can get heavy). I don’t know how much hair you have, so I can’t suggest how much to use.

When it's time to shampoo that out, I use only a very   tiny tiny bit of Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration shampoo added to a squeezy bottle of distilled water., to scrub roots and rake through to the ends. Then rinse with a separate squeezy bottle of water or 2.  I don't even use a special towel anymore, and no post-poo conditioner.

whenever i try s2c, i find that the roots of my hair are sticking to my scalp whch leads to a very weird curl where the root of my curl is flat due to the sticking, and as a result my hair just curls weirdly. i don't know if its because of the scrunching with the conditioner, and my hair just can't handle that much conditioner, or something else but i was wondering if there was any way to solve this? if not, i was thinking of just going back to my old way of just rinsing out my conditioner upside down and then scrunching in my products, which seemed to work better.

but in general, i've noticed some weird hair problems lately. the hair in the middle of my head is very dry, like no matter how much conditioner i put in it always just is dry. i've always noticed that my curls have lately seemed to be falling much flatter with less volume than usual. i've tried both a protein treatment and a cleansing treatment as i do use silicone in one of my products, and that hasn't seemed to work. i can't tell if it's because the hair on top of my head has been growing somewhat long, and perhaps the weight is just causing the curls to fall flat? idk, i was just wondering if anyone had any potential suggestions for me/answers.",3c,  prevent    hair    sticking    scalp general    hair    problems so    fine    hair     3b 3c     low    porosity     short    sides    longer    top     i m    guy      i m    issues    s2c    method     general    hair    problems     whenever    try    s2c     find    roots    hair    sticking    scalp    whch    leads    weird    curl    root    curl    flat    due    sticking     result    hair    curls    weirdly     know    scrunching    conditioner     hair    can t    handle    much    conditioner     something    else    wondering    way    solve    this     not     thinking    going    back    old    way    rinsing    conditioner    upside    scrunching    products     seemed    work    better     general     i ve    noticed    weird    hair    problems    lately     hair    middle    head    dry     like    matter    much    conditioner    put    always    dry     i ve    always    noticed    curls    lately    seemed    falling    much    flatter    less    volume    usual     i ve    tried    protein    treatment    cleansing    treatment    use    silicone    one    products     seemed    work     can t    tell    hair    top    head    growing    somewhat    long     perhaps    weight    causing    curls    fall    flat     idk     wondering    anyone    potential    suggestions    me answers   ,prevent hair sticking scalp general hair problem so fine hair 3b 3c low porosity short side longer top i m guy i m issue s2c method general hair problem whenever try s2c find root hair sticking scalp whch lead weird curl root curl flat due sticking result hair curl weirdly know scrunching conditioner hair can t handle much conditioner something else wondering way solve this not thinking going back old way rinsing conditioner upside scrunching product seemed work better general i ve noticed weird hair problem lately hair middle head dry like matter much conditioner put always dry i ve always noticed curl lately seemed falling much flatter le volume usual i ve tried protein treatment cleansing treatment use silicone one product seemed work can t tell hair top head growing somewhat long perhaps weight causing curl fall flat idk wondering anyone potential suggestion me answer,prevent hair sticking scalp general hair problem fine hair 3b 3c low porosity short side longer top guy issue s2c method general hair problem whenever try s2c find root hair sticking scalp whch lead weird curl root curl flat due sticking result hair curl weirdly know scrunching conditioner hair handle much conditioner something else wondering way solve thinking going back old way rinsing conditioner upside scrunching product seemed work better general noticed weird hair problem lately hair middle head dry like matter much conditioner put always dry always noticed curl lately seemed falling much flatter le volume usual tried protein treatment cleansing treatment use silicone one product seemed work tell hair top head growing somewhat long perhaps weight causing curl fall flat idk wondering anyone potential suggestion answer
318,5037,/r/curlyhair/comments/b5gb0m/volume_to_the_gods/ejd9l79/,"So, I just got my hair cut by a professional curly hairdresser, and I cannot stress the difference it makes. My hair went from a 2b to a 3b/c. 


However, when it was first cut, and I did my usual routine, it was looking a little like it’s old self. So I decided to break the rules and wash it straight away again the next day, which has made it bounce into the beautiful, voluminous, curly mess that I got in the salon. 


Routine:
• Haven’t straightened hair since January 2018
• Have been following the CGM since January 2018

• Soak hair in shower, squeeze out all excess moisture (as hairdresser said) so the hair isn’t sopping wet. 
• Apply Garnier Ultimate Blends Hair Food In Banana and Shea Butter, untangling my hair with my fingers and raking in the product. 
• Again, squeezing in the product and squeezing out excess moisture. 
• Leaving the mask to sit for 2 hours, watch some Netflix. 
• Back I’m shower, wash out hair mask with cold water for 8 seconds. 
• Extra conditioner - TRESemmé Botanique, again, squishing our extra moisture, applying conditioner, raking it through hair, and squeezing out the excess - leave for 3 minutes. 
• Wash out the conditioner in 8 seconds, turn shower off. 
• Squeeze our water, apply Shea Moisture JMCO leave-in by raking it through and squishing it in. 
• Apply Boots Curl Creme by raking it through hair. 
• Squish all of the hair together so everything saturated into the hair. 
• Scrunch upwards and waddle across the hall with my head upside down. 
• Grab a microfibre towel and scrunch out excess moisture. 
• DO NOT PLOP
• Diffuse, low heat + medium heat in bursts of 20 seconds per section with head flipped upside down the entire time. 
• Diffuse until neck gets stiff and hair feels 100% dry. 
• Style into the position I want my hair and realise it isn’t ACTUALLY 100% dry. 
• Diffuse the rest standing up with hair in the style I want.

319,12395,/r/curlyhair/comments/dzj277/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/f8wlvcc/,"Hey guys! I've been having a few problems with my hair. I have slightly above the shoulder 2B-2C (or just barely 3a) hair with normal-ish (on the lower spectrum) porosity and little damage. 

My current routine involves cowashing with the standard Tresemme conditioner. After my shower, I squish water out of my hair with a shirt and use the praying hands method to apply LA sports gel; then I scrunch the gel in until my hands are on fire. Plop for an hour, let it airdry, then I throw it up in a pineapple without SOTC (although this doesn't seem to work, so I'll be changing that. I also just bought my first diffuser!!) Sometimes I'll use a few other products before gel, like Bella Curls Curl Defining Creme or Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I deep condition once every week or two with Shea Moisture Coconut Oil.

1. My hair naturally parts further over to the right, so I have a ton of hair over to the right and not a lot on the left. Consequently, my right is fairly well defined and voluminous, but my left side is lacking. My left side is more like waves. I also tend to sleep on my left side, which really doesn't seem to help. What can I do to help my left side live up to the right without having to change my part?
2. How does one know when to clarify? I'm having a hard time determining it.
3. On day 2-3, my curls are pretty much waves - which I'm fine with - but the frizz is horrible. Some parts even look totally straight! How can I help redefine my waves/curls? I have a spray bottle and numerous products at my disposal :)

320,4504,/r/curlyhair/comments/afxyl8/cg_beginner_routine_day_3/ee3kbbh/,"I've been doing this for about 3 months. This is my current routine for my 2b/c hair.

I do tresemme, then, without squeezing any water out, I use a very small amount of la gel because it gives me really good clumping and definition. Then I squish out excess water and apply a larger amount of biolage ultra defining gel. It's from Sally beauty and will not break the bank. 

Using just la looks weighs down my hair way too much. Just biolage didn't give good definition. The two together work really well.  Wish I hadn't spent so much on product before figuring this out.

Then I squish with a microfiber towel. Plopping never seemed to do much for me, so I quit. &amp; i diffuse later if I an feeling ambitious. I also use a cala tangle free brush when I condition. Found it at TJ Maxx for cheap and love it.

Best of luck with figuring it out!

Honestly not cg approved, but I'm working on it

Shampoo: Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Shampoo

Conditioner: Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Conditioner

Deep condition: OGX argan oil deep conditioner

Hair products: Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Smoothie, and occasionally some lavender almond oil on the ends as needed

Wash day routine: prepoo with olive oil or sunflower oil, shampoo, condition, comb hair with conditioner in it, then deep condition for +/- 15 minutes. Rinse 80% out. Apply curling smoothie with praying hands and raking it through, detangling any knots I missed. Let it dry, sometimes down, sometimes in a loose bun.

I shampoo as needed, since it depends on weather, buildup, and such. I condition every other day. I put my hair in a pineapple or topknot to sleep.

Also, if anyone has any idea, can you help me figure out my curl type? It's usually a mix of 2b/2c/3a, with a few 3b spots, but I might be wrong.

Reset wash with VO5 clarifying shampoo kiwi lime squeeze. 

Deep condition with two egg yolks, two tbsp olive oil, two tbsp honey. Leave on for 30 minutes. (Should’ve done double the amount for my thick AF hair.) 

No co-washing for reset day. 

Conditioner after deep conditioning with Cantu Shea Butter for natural hair conditioning co-wash applied by scrunching in divided sections in shower. Didn’t rinse it out completely and let it act as a leave-in. 

Gel: Giovanni LA hold styling gel extreme hold. Applied to sopping wet hair by scrunching. 

Drying: Tried plopping with a microfiber towel, failed miserably, so I gently scrunched with the microfiber towel. 

Diffused to mostly-dry with low temperature on low speed. Then scrunched in some Aunt Jackie’s seal it up hydrating sealing butter and Shea Moisture silicone free miracle styler leave-in treatment which smells like all the pre-teen boys in 1999. 

My hair is enigmatic. It has changed so much. As a small child I had stuck straight brown hair that turned BLONDE in the sun- it looked like my mom had given me blonde chunky highlights. Eventually it turned to perfect-poo-brown and started to get volume and minimal waves some time during elementary school. The waves increased in middle school and would full-on curl beneath my shoulders if I slept with wet hair. That’s how it stayed but it was the mid 2000’s when I started high school and I straightened the bejeezus out of it. Then I wore it up constantly for years when my step mom gave me a mullet, A MULLET, without my consent. (She is a professional and even owns her own salon. I think she hated me.) 

So now I have apparently 2a-c coarse strands with lots of natural volume at the roots from a full crown of a cowlick. Literally. It swirls fully around the top of my head. 

Porosity you ask? Not a clue. My hair has features of high a low porosity despite it being virgin hair that never sees heat. I just cut off three inches the other day because of how dry and sad it gets past my ears. The cuticles were chipped all over, a real tragedy. Hopefully throwing all of the moisture at it with CG will help that!!!

Does everyone wash/detangle/apply product upside down? If I do that then my hair basically sticks straight out from my ears when I dry. But if I go right side up it’s like my hair bunched at the ends and they pull on each other once gravity is applied right side up so I get crazy roots and a rat’s nest. But if I do everything right side up, I can’t get any lift (tried clipping, other techniques I saw on YouTube). 

My hair is quite fine, mostly wavy (2b/2c and occasional 3a) and very long. I do plan on cutting soon. I have to comb it in the shower with a detangler comb (wide tooth alone doesn’t cut it).

331,15694,/r/curlyhair/comments/alqc20/9_months_with_the_cg_method_my_hair_has_been/efg1tur/," I have 3a, protein loving, low porosity hair. Fighting frizz and staying moisturized are definitely my main challenges with this hair type.   

Current routine:  

I wash every 4-5 days depending on my schedule/how my hair is looking. 

Wash days:  

1. Co-wash with **Eden Bodyworks Coconut Co-Wash**. I really scrub my scalp and then soak my hair with this stuff and finger comb to detangle. Then I clip it all up and throw on a shower cap. Set the shower to hot to create steam to open up the hair shaft and allow the moisture to soak in. Really important step for low porosity hair! Otherwise the product just sits on top of your hair and doesn't actually moisturize the way it should. Rinse well with cold or cool water.  

2. Deep condition with **SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Hair Masque**. I use squish to condish here plus add a little extra closer to the scalp too. Clip up, shower cap, hot steam (same set up as above). Rinse completely with cold or cool water.  

3. Apply **SheaMoisture Low Porosity Protein-Free Leave-in** using S2C method. I'm actually thinking of swapping this product out with something else for a little extra moisture and protein (any recommendations?? Let me know!). It seems to work well on days 1 and 2, but I also use my leave-in to refresh my hair each morning, and I think this product isn't quite moisturizing enough/doesn't have enough protein for my hair.  

4. Apply **Biotera Alcohol Free Defining Gel** using S2C method. It makes my hair clump up nicely and creates a light gel cast. 

5. Scrunch out water with a cotton T-shirt. I usually just air dry after this, but if I'm more in a hurry I will diffuse on low temp using the pixie method until about 30% dry then air dry the rest of the way. Scrunch out the crunch once it's completely dry. 

Non-wash days: 

I sleep with a silk pillowcase, which helps a lot with avoiding frizz while you sleep. Seriously, this makes a huge difference! 

\- On days 2-3, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair and apply some SM leave-in (listed above) and then biotera gel using S2C method for both. Air dry then scrunch out the crunch. 

\- On days 3-4, I use a spray bottle to dampen my hair and use the SM leave-in and **ECO Aloe Vera Styling Gel** using S2C method. This gel has a stronger hold and is good for re-forming curls that have come undone over the first couple of days. Air dry then scrunch out the crunch.  

Notes:  

\-Every month or so, I will also cleanse my hair with whatever cheap shampoo we have in the shower to get rid of any build-up.

\-If my hair is particularly dry and frizzy (usually in winter months), I will also do extra deep conditionings on day 3 by rinsing my hair with cool/cold water and applying SM Manuka &amp; Mafura Hair Masque (same as above). Then I clip up my hair, put on a shower cap, and diffuse over the cap on medium temp for 10-20 minutes. Rinse out completely with cool/cold water. This really helps me keep up with much-needed moisture.

I picked this up at Winners for $8 and was pretty excited because I have read mostly positive things about Giovanni. I used it in my regular routine: Devacurl No-Poo shampoo and Oneka unscented conditioner (I have shoulder length 2c/3a hair). I applied about a tablespoon of the gel to nearly dripping wet hair with praying hands, then used a comb to distribute the gel, then finally squished from tips to roots. I plopped for a 1/2 hour then air dried.

* While dry: great gel cast, curls have pretty good definition, gel has a nice smell
* After SOTC: not much volume but good definition, hair felt weighed down
* After a few hours: lots of frizz forming, some loss of definition
* Next morning (pineapple scrunchie and satin pillowcase): hair feels crusty and dry, lots of frizz everywhere. Throughout the day today I've noticed chunks of white flakes from the gel stuck to my hair. Lots of tangles, which I haven't had in a very long time.

Verdict: definitely not for me, I will be happily returning to my homemade flax gel once I manage to wash this out of my hair. For comparison, I can usually go at least 3 days after washing when using flax gel and still have good definition (and no gross buildup).",2c,  quick    review    giovanni    l a     natural    styling    gelposting    find    many    recent    reviews    product    sub     picked    winners     8    pretty    excited    read    mostly    positive    things    giovanni     used    regular    routine     devacurl    no poo    shampoo    oneka    unscented    conditioner     i    shoulder    length    2c 3a    hair      applied    tablespoon    gel    nearly    dripping    wet    hair    praying    hands     used    comb    distribute    gel     finally    squished    tips    roots     plopped    1 2    hour    air    dried          dry     great    gel    cast     curls    pretty    good    definition     gel    nice    smell         sotc     much    volume    good    definition     hair    felt    weighed         hours     lots    frizz    forming     loss    definition         next    morning     pineapple    scrunchie    satin    pillowcase      hair    feels    crusty    dry     lots    frizz    everywhere     throughout    day    today    i ve    noticed    chunks    white    flakes    gel    stuck    hair     lots    tangles     long    time     verdict     definitely    me     happily    returning    homemade    flax    gel    manage    wash    hair     comparison     usually    go    least    3    days    washing    using    flax    gel    still    good    definition     and    gross    buildup    ,quick review giovanni l a natural styling gelposting find many recent review product sub picked winner 8 pretty excited read mostly positive thing giovanni used regular routine devacurl no poo shampoo oneka unscented conditioner i shoulder length 2c 3a hair applied tablespoon gel nearly dripping wet hair praying hand used comb distribute gel finally squished tip root plopped 1 2 hour air dried dry great gel cast curl pretty good definition gel nice smell sotc much volume good definition hair felt weighed hour lot frizz forming loss definition next morning pineapple scrunchie satin pillowcase hair feel crusty dry lot frizz everywhere throughout day today i ve noticed chunk white flake gel stuck hair lot tangle long time verdict definitely me happily returning homemade flax gel manage wash hair comparison usually go least 3 day washing using flax gel still good definition and gross buildup,quick review giovanni l natural styling gelposting find many recent review product sub picked winner 8 pretty excited read mostly positive thing giovanni used regular routine devacurl poo shampoo oneka unscented conditioner shoulder length 2c 3a hair applied tablespoon gel nearly dripping wet hair praying hand used comb distribute gel finally squished tip root plopped 1 2 hour air dried dry great gel cast curl pretty good definition gel nice smell sotc much volume good definition hair felt weighed hour lot frizz forming loss definition next morning pineapple scrunchie satin pillowcase hair feel crusty dry lot frizz everywhere throughout day today noticed chunk white flake gel stuck hair lot tangle long time verdict definitely happily returning homemade flax gel manage wash hair comparison usually go least 3 day washing using flax gel still good definition gross buildup

1. Knowing if you need a protein treatment or deep conditioning treatment. I did the rice water soak and I think it did more harm than good. But I got a sample of the Cantu deep treatment hair masque and followed their instructions before my most recent wash day and my hair just felt so much better. I had far bigger clumps, more definition, and it’s sooooo soft now.

2. Double gel application. I can’t recall the YouTuber who talked about this, but it helped my a ton. My routine is usually leave in, curl cream, and gel, plop for about 20 min (I have A LOT of hair) and diffuse. But I’ve recently started adding a second coat of gel after plopping and for the first time I’ve been getting a really great gel cast!

3. SLEEPING WITH THE GEL CAST. Y’all when I say I woke up this morning in disbelief, I was in shock. I bought one of those cheap silk head scarves from target &amp; sort of plopped my dry, gel casted hair into the scarf very loosely and slept like that. I’ve noticed with my kind of waves, a pineapple just doesn’t do it and I have to do a huge refresh every morning and it sucks. I get very frizzy and flat overnight even though I don’t toss &amp; turn much at all. But once I took off the scarf this morning, I was amazed at how voluminous my hair was and how beautiful my waves were. Sleeping had helped SOTC a bit and I used a tiny bit of oil in the morning to get the rest of the crunch out and my hair feels healthier than it EVER has. I’m so delighted and amazed. There are finally some 2c curls in there and best of all, the underneath layer of my hair (which is almost always flat and poofy and sad) has big beautiful waves.

Obviously I don’t know how this would work on other curl types, but I figured I’d share these tips to those struggling when starting out like I was!",2b,  psa     fellow    waviesso    hit    plateau

348,15931,/r/curlyhair/comments/avlnwb/first_attempt_at_something_new_and_i_get_the/ehg2mas/,"So I have been experimenting with the CG method for a little while now (a few months or so). I finally did a little more research and found out that I have low porosity hair so I decided to change when I apply my curl cream and gel. The following is my routine:

I use Ogx Nurishing Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner (I think they're CG, but not 100% positive). I shampooed like normal (which is every day) by raking my fingers through my hair to detangle. I then applied conditioner and squished it in. For many years now I have let the conditioner stay in my hair while I wash my body so I did that as well. When I washed it out, I scrunched in the water and squeezed the water out that way. Then I immediately applied Oliology Coconut Oil Curl Cream (pretty sure not CG) with prayer hands and scrunched. Then I plopped in a t-shirt for like 5 minutes. Then I applied Devacurl light defining gel with prayer hands and scrunched some more. I then let it air dry. When it was dry I scrunched out the crunch and fluffed a little. I may try the gel in my hair while still wet to help with frizz, but I'm really pleased with the curl. I think I have 3a with some 3b in there. 

Hopefully this helps some!! I have pretty thin hair and nothing I saw on here ever seemed to apply to my hair type. :]",3a,  experimenting    cg    method    little     a    months    so      finally    little    research    found    low    porosity    hair    decided    change    apply    curl    cream    gel     following    routine     use    ogx    nurishing    coconut    milk    shampoo    conditioner     i    think    they re    cg     100     positive      shampooed    like    normal     which    every    day     raking    fingers    hair    detangle     applied    conditioner    squished    in     many    years    let    conditioner    stay    hair    wash    body    well     washed    out     scrunched    water    squeezed    water    way     immediately    applied    oliology    coconut    oil    curl    cream     pretty    sure    cg     prayer    hands    scrunched     plopped    t shirt    like    5    minutes     applied    devacurl    light    defining    gel    prayer    hands    scrunched    more     let    air    dry     dry    scrunched    crunch    fluffed    little     may    try    gel    hair    still    wet    help    frizz     i m    really    pleased    curl     think    3a    3b    there     hopefully    helps    some      pretty    thin    hair    nothing    saw    ever    seemed    apply    hair    type         ,experimenting cg method little a month so finally little research found low porosity hair decided change apply curl cream gel following routine use ogx nurishing coconut milk shampoo conditioner i think they re cg 100 positive shampooed like normal which every day raking finger hair detangle applied conditioner squished in many year let conditioner stay hair wash body well washed out scrunched water squeezed water way immediately applied oliology coconut oil curl cream pretty sure cg prayer hand scrunched plopped t shirt like 5 minute applied devacurl light defining gel prayer hand scrunched more let air dry dry scrunched crunch fluffed little may try gel hair still wet help frizz i m really pleased curl think 3a 3b there hopefully help some pretty thin hair nothing saw ever seemed apply hair type,experimenting cg method little month finally little research found low porosity hair decided change apply curl cream gel following routine use ogx nurishing coconut milk shampoo conditioner think cg 100 positive shampooed like normal every day raking finger hair detangle applied conditioner squished many year let conditioner stay hair wash body well washed scrunched water squeezed water way immediately applied oliology coconut oil curl cream pretty sure cg prayer hand scrunched plopped shirt like 5 minute applied devacurl light defining gel prayer hand scrunched let air dry dry scrunched crunch fluffed little may try gel hair still wet help frizz really pleased curl think 3a 3b hopefully help pretty thin hair nothing saw ever seemed apply hair type

I have to try and moisturize a bunch of different layers and the dry/split ends are hard to trim since they are all different sizes. It’s like spreading dry/split ends from only the ends if your hair to all over your hair. Its made me really unhappy with my hair and the layers take forever to grow and as they grow they get dry and split so I continue to attempt to trim. Trimming is also harder when you have 10 different lengths scattered all over. My hair is now a bunch of different sizes With too many layers.

Blunt cuts or very minimal layers seem to  make curly hair stronger and overall much easier to grow out and maintain healthy. Tons of layers = hard to grow out and more exposed ends. My layers seems to expose the hair to more damage but more difficult to trim. Sighs*

The point here is to take precaution and think about your hair type and it’s growth rate. Make sure you notice how much people are trimming! I had no idea how much had been cut until it was too late. I also didn’t think about how much trouble it would cause my hair long-term, imy hair looked great!

I think curly dry cuts can be awesome and manageable if not overdone!   Face framing is great because it isn’t much hair . I will continue to dry cut my hair and face frame  as well. 
However, I would take HEAVY precaution against cutting 360 layers and reaaaally think about how much and how short.

364,9956,/r/curlyhair/comments/agxlve/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_jan_17_2019/eephmwj/,"I’ve been sulfate free since 2014. Since then I’ve gone through phases with washing my hair (twice a week, 3 times a week, once a week, once every 10 days!) and haven’t found anything that sticks. I’ve experimented with plopping, different products, etc. 

Now I’m doing the official CG method and I’m just wondering how long it’ll take to see change - and if any change will even happen. I have 2c-3A hair and my routine is as follows:

Wash once a week with DC shampoo
Condition with DC decadence, leave most of it in 
Use LA looks gel or DC gel
Diffuse at 50% dry, SOTC with Trader Joe’s argan oil. 

Tbh, there’s slightly less frizz but the difference is pretty negligible and I can’t really get that happy medium between too much gel and tons of definition, and not enough gel and tons of frizz. Using a styling cream contributes to that “producty” feeling in my hair. Pineappling doesn’t do anything to preserve and neither does a satin bonnet or pillowcase. 

I’m just at a loss. I told my BF that it would be easier to just blow my hair out straight once a week because this just doesn’t seem worth it anymore. I’m not seeing noticeably healthier hair, I’m not seeing more curls. I’ve been doing this for almost 5 years now and it’s just so frustrating. I went to a DC stylist and had a great cut and styling session, but then when I got home and had to redo my hair, I couldn’t replicate it.

All of the mentioned products REALLY dried out my hair and the smell is a little too much for me to handle (surprisingly, these products - except for the gel - have sort of a chemical smell that’s very strong). 

The gel didn’t really give me any definition at all, but I guess it is a light defining gel so I couldn’t have expected much out of it. 

After spending some time “styling” my hair with these products, my hair looks like I haven’t styled it at all (lol). It feels extremely rough and frizzy and smells like chemicals! I was not at all pleased. Has anyone had a similar experience?

I was wondering if anyone here has any product recommendations (preferably affordable!) that will help me achieve the “curly girl method” look. All help is appreciated :)

I’ve tried using various sleeping caps and different hair styles like buns and braids but no matter what I do, I always have this crown of frizz I have to tame! 

I do live in a relatively humid place (usually 40%+) so that could definitely be part of the issue but I’m unsure what steps to take to combat this nonetheless. 

Routine: 

I either shower or wet my hair using a spray bottle with a little bit of the Tresemme botanique coconut and aloe conditioner mixed in to the water in the spray bottle. 

I only wash my hair every Sunday with the Shea Moisture moisture retention shampoo with sea kelp and Aragon oil but I use conditioner everyday (Tresemme ^) by just smoothing it on below my ears, waiting a minute, using a wide tooth comb to distribute and then rinsing it out. I then take a tiny bit more of conditioner and do S2C. I also use the Garnier 1 minute coconut conditioner mask for roughly 20 minutes on wash days. 

I squeeze the majority of the water from my hair because I hate the way wet hair feels on my back and then I scrunch in Herbal Essence totally twisted curl mousse, then a tiny bit of LA looks sports gel, then I scrunch with a microfiber towel until I get the wave pattern I’m going for, then air dry! Sometimes I use a diffuser on low and warm if I’m in a super rush but it makes my hair more frizzy lol.

372,3263,/r/curlyhair/comments/8niasv/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_may_31_2018/e0oa19r/,"Is it hard water?  Every time my 2b waves start misbehaving, I find it ends up being hard water and maybe some other buildup.  Firstly, try a CG shampoo in case there’s some sort of stubborn product buildup.   If that doesn’t work, consider googling the water profile of your area to see if you can find it’s hardness.  Hard water buildup needs a chelating agent, Disodium EDTA being one of them.  In the UK I’m using a clarifying shampoo by Tresemme because it’s cheap and does the job.

It has sulphates and is pretty drying, but no silicones.  I find hard water buildup stops my products working on my hair, including my conditioners. So the cleanse is drying but also helps my moisturisers work a lot better.

373,35669,/r/curlyhair/comments/8x375o/advice_for_a_new_curly/,"Advice for a new curly? :)I just learned about the curly girl method and decided to give it a try. I had been basically cowashing for a long time, a couple of years, with once to twice a month Moroccan Oil shampoo (has silicones) and about once to twice per week Art Naturals Argan Oil Hair Mask (has silicones and keratin). This morning I did a wash with Mane N Tail, which appears to have sodium lauryl sulfate and no silicones. Then I did squish to condish with a lot of Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Intensely Soft leave in, praying hands/squish to condish with Garnier Fructis curl sculpting cream, and then praying hands/squish without water with Aussie instant freeze gel. I plopped in a t-shirt for about 20 minutes, then air dried; once it was dry I scrunched out the crunch. I saw the Garnier Fructis leave in has amodimethicone, but it's too late to return it now! :P I also bought some Tresemme for cowashing but got the wrong kind, luckily I noticed that before using it. Anyway, does anyone have advice for how to help my hair clump back into curls/advice in general? Does it look like my hair has too much protein? I have some 2b/2c waves throughout and a few nice looking 3a/maybe 3b curls on the underside (pictures linked below). I think my hair is normal porosity (takes a long time to dry but it's very thick, does not seem to have product build up or sit on the surface), very thick, and more coarse than fine? Thanks in advance for any advice!

Does everyone wash/detangle/apply product upside down? If I do that then my hair basically sticks straight out from my ears when I dry. But if I go right side up it’s like my hair bunched at the ends and they pull on each other once gravity is applied right side up so I get crazy roots and a rat’s nest. But if I do everything right side up, I can’t get any lift (tried clipping, other techniques I saw on YouTube). 

My hair is quite fine, mostly wavy (2b/2c and occasional 3a) and very long. I do plan on cutting soon. I have to comb it in the shower with a detangler comb (wide tooth alone doesn’t cut it).

I’ve tried a bunch of different combos of products and methods but nothing seems to be leaving me with hair that isn’t a rats nest before even scrunching.

375,32666,/r/curlyhair/comments/8ugkwu/2c_low_porosity_desperately_seeks_same_and_some/,"2c low porosity desperately seeks same (and some serious help)Ok sooo I've been on this curly journey for 6ish months now and, y'all, I am STRUGGLING. I have 2c(3a in a couple spots), thinish, low porosity, colored hair that's recovering from being bleached for the past year so it needs moisture desperately. I generally use loma shampoo once a week to get rid of buildup, and then either tresemme conditioner to cowash or devacurl one conditioner (I tried a repair/restore SM conditioner but it was too heavy, it might have been the one I got, though.) I then use KC knot today and ecostyler gel (in the green container) OR the devacurl light defining gel... but unless I use a TON of the ecostyler gel, nothing seems to hold for more than an hour or two, and I just end up looking SCRAGGLY and gross. I'm afraid that using so much of the heavy gel is just weighing down my hair, and I don't feel like using that much of the Devacurl gel really does much of anything, annnd I still frizz like a mofo. Oh, I also have been trying the hask treatments once a week which make my hair softer, at least.   


SO... I guess what I'm asking for is 2fold– any recs on product in general (deep conditioner for moisture, maybe a better hold gel), and 2...should I just toss what I've got and start over? I'm doing plopping, raking and squishing product gently...I think I'm doing stuff right but it's getting to a point even on wash days where I look so not cute after a couple hours that I just want to put it up and it's so defeating. Any help would be REALLY great.   


Photo attached for reference...my curls were like 80&amp;#37; gone in a couple of hours :( I want them to stay like this! Thank you curly geniuses! &lt;3

What I'm wondering is this: What is the likelihood that I'll see a change in curl pattern once I start getting my hair fully moisturized and I'm avoiding the silicones and whatnot? 

Before CG, if I washed my hair and let it dry naturally, I get soft 2B waves... and definitely some frizz the moment I run my fingers through it. If I use gel and a diffuser, I am a bouncy 2B with some 2C pieces. I'm just wondering what the likelihood is that I'll step up to the next level, say a full 2C or a 3a all over? 

My hair is somewhat long — the longest comes down to almost my bra strap and I do have some long layers in my hair. It's also dark brown and super thick (I think my strands are actually not individually thick, but not super thin, either, but I have a ton of hair).

Very happy to have these results after only 3 weeks! My hair type is fine, lots of it, high porosity with badly damaged bleached highlights. I’m not sure of my curl type... maybe a mix of 2A, 2B, 2C...?

Current routine as follows:

Wash every other day... I have very greasy roots.

* Wash with Living Proof PHD shampoo
* Condition with Living Proof PHD conditioner, squish to condish, leave for 5 mins
* Tip head upside down, rake fingers through hair to make sure it’s properly detangled, rinse out 
* Squeeze our excess water
* Apply a small amount of As I Am leave in conditioner, working up from the ends, rake through and squish to condish
* Squeeze out excess water and plop in microfibre towel for 15 mins
* With head upside down use microfibre towel to squish out excess water
* Apply As I Am curling jelly with clapping hands, scrunch in
* Air dry

I do a co-wash every 2nd washday - I use As I Am co-wash.

I deep condition with Garnier fruit blends (the banana one) and I use a protein mask weekly (Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yoghurt).

I’ve got a few new products on the way including Curls Blueberry Bliss leave-in and Giovanni natural styling gel to try something with a stronger hold.

399,22581,/r/curlyhair/comments/93f1jh/when_the_sunlight_hits_your_curls_just_right/e3dwcc5/,"Thank you thank you! My transition was awful honestly... I didn’t know where to start and I kept watching YouTube videos from girls who didn’t look like me and tried just about everything and 90% of what they did and their textures didn’t work for me. I use to wear my hair only in braids and natural styles to keep from putting heat on it, however I would at most times revert back to my old straightening ways.

My hair stopped growing since I was damaging it by straightening it, so I decided that I would be natural and that I needed to find a routine.

I knew how to do two strand twist, after seeing a bunch on YouTube’s, and basically started with simple products that I knew I needed to keep the curls intact
1-Gel-to keep the curl and curl and not frizz
2-Oil to keep it moisturized and help it grow

Eco styler gel is really good for 3c/4a hair like mine. Don’t let the perfect curls in the front fool you there are some kinks in the back lol. The gel is soft on curls but hard against the environment which is why my curls stayed 3 days later.

Castor Oil is crazy thick... like super thick, but honestly without it my hair wouldn’t have grown as fast from my big chop.

My big chop looked awful! I looked like a boy.. I could only wear my hair with headbands or Bobbi pins in a Mohawk formation. However... if I didn’t do it, it wouldn’t have forced me to start my journey and to find a routine. 
I have a picture that I can send you or add to this post.
[Big Chop January 2017](https://imgur.com/gallery/JjcyfuT) 

To answer your question about your ends- try using a perm curl rod at the end with some gel. It will force a curl however it won’t make it as curly as your roots.

I got to the point with my straight-ends where I just told my hair dresser to cut them off. At that point I figured out how to grow my hair and I knew I could get that length back if it stuck to my routine.

I’ve never bleached/dyed or even regularly used heat. What gives? I’ve also been trying the curly method for about a year with no results. If anything, my hair is more stretched out/weighed down then ever. Gel seems to be my enemy. From what I’ve been able to determine, my hair is low porosity, but likes protein (which I know is a contradiction.) It used to be 3b, now some 2b mostly 2a. I’ve spent countless time and money trying to get my hair back to normal and I feel like giving up and just straightening it! 

Current Routine:

1. 2xs per week cleanse with sulfate free shampoo (have tried a variety including CG options). 

2. Flip upside down and stc, currently with keratin oil conditioner. Leave in for a few minutes.

3. Praying hands AG recoil gel while still in the shower.

4. Plop.

5. Air dry.

Little hair info - I had bleached/blue hair for years, then I dyed it back but would straighten/curl it, and now I'm finally free! I did a big chop and left it alone for a year. The only thing that remains in my hair is a bit of old henna at the bottom. 

So... I need some guidance. My hair feels healthy, but I honestly don't know what it does ""naturally"" because the slightest change in my routine and my hair looks TOTALLY different. Brush it wet? Straightish but omg so fluffy. Towel turban? Under layers are curly, top layer isn't. Go out with wet hair when it's windy? Dear god... Help us all. 

I recently discovered the curly girl method and there's just soooo much info, and I'm really tempted to drop some major $$ to test it out - because I'm frustrated and bored with whatever the heck my hair is doing now. The only thing is - I don't even know if I qualify as curly? My under layers do get a little curly, but then they sag when it fully dries. My top layer isn't really, other than at the bottom. I have veerrry thick, Maltese hair and most of my cousins/aunts have type 3B or 3C hair, but I think it skipped me. 

I think 2A''s are curlier than I am, but my hair also doesn't feel straight? Ahh any guidance at all would be so appreciated. Should I try it out?

I shower daily and pre-CG shampooed daily too. I still shower daily and I do get my hair wet each time (it’s doable for me because my hair is fine and thin so doesn’t take a crazy long time to dry. Drying time is probably the main reason some people don’t wash or even wet their hair every day). 

I co wash daily with Tresemme coconut and aloe conditioner or mill creek biotin conditioner if my hair needs the protein. I only use herbal essences totally twisted gel to style, and I style about 4x a week. Every 5-7 days I wash with Giovanni 2chic anti frizz which is a low poo shampoo, and I follow it with garnier’s coconut 1 minute treat hair mask. Once every 4-6 weeks I do a cleansing wash with neutrogena anti residue shampoo just to thoroughly clean, and follow it with the garnier mask cuz sulphates dry my hair right out. 

I’d say if your hair takes ages to dry, consider washing it less often and using leave-in conditioners. If it dries reasonably quick or you’re ok with diffusing or just waiting, then co wash or low poo wash as often as you feel you need to. Co wash and low poo don’t strip your scalp so they can be done daily without damage. The one thing I *wouldn’t* do is use a sulphate shampoo more than 1x a week at most.

413,15127,/r/curlyhair/comments/9xb0q7/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_nov_15_2018/ea5b4du/,"I have a few questions but first the routine!

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a 2B/C curl pattern, although in the past I was more of a 3A. I am currently using the Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle shampoo (low-poo) and the TRESemme Botanicals Coconut conditioner. I shampoo, add conditioner, use a wide tooth comb when wet in the shower to detangle, then S2C. I then squeeze any water out, apply a leave in conditioner (I am currently going between Not Your Mothers Naturals Leave in in the yellow bottle and Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave in) I then apply the blue LA Looks gel with praying hands, scrunch, and plop for about an hour. I then diffuse on low heat or cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed I haven't been getting very good clumps and my waves seem extremely thin and not defined. The frizz has significantly decreased since adding a leave in, which is good. I am still experimenting with products and attempting to determine my porosity (if anyone has any suggestions besides trial and error or the cup test, let me know!). 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a way to have better clumping or definition when drying?
2. I typically shower at night, but notice my hair is just flat and my curls have mostly been pulled out by the time I wake up.

I recently got passion twists as my first protective hairstyle. I love the look and the feeling of long hair, but I have one issue: my scalp itches like hell. 

After looking it up online, I decided to try an apple cider vinegar rinse. I’m planning on mixing about two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and one cup of water ( I have a dry scalp). Online it says to rinse you hair with water after leaving the apple cider vinegar for about an hour. 

How do I rinse my hair with these twists in? I have 3B (ish) hair that I have to re-twist with my fake hair regularly. I’m afraid that if I apply large amounts of water to my head, my real hair will come undone from the twists  and I’ll have to redo a majority of my hair.

424,6232,/r/curlyhair/comments/ctx81g/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/ey3ahpu/,"I'm liking my current routine, and have definitely noticed my hair becoming MUCH healthier and with a BIT of more curl, but it's more so fluffy than defined. I'm willing to try out new products (have been looking to Shea Moisture mainly), but ideally nothing more than 10$ per product. My current routine is as follows:

* Shampoo with Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying Shampoo once a month, sometimes longer or shorter
* Cowash with TRESemme Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish every 3-5 days
* Deep condition with Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Yogurt Mask every other week.
* On off days I scrub my scalp with lukewarm water (never hot!), give myself a little head massage, and rinse with color water. Scrunch out excess water and/or scrunch with cotton t-shirt and let air dry. Shift the roots a little bit for extra volume.

I feel like my current routine is pretty nice so far, and have, again, noticed a lot of improvement in hair health overall, but I feel that with the right products, I can get more definition and volume.

I've been considering the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Intensive Repair mask as a primary moisturizing deep conditioner, and substituting the Intensive Repair mask on days that I need that extra moisture. However, my hair tends to lose the majority of its curl if I use too heavy of products. I would say on a good day, I can get 2c/3a curls in the front/bangs (I don't know why I only get them here), with mostly 2a/2b waves in the back/sides of my hair.

Instead of cowashing today, I opted to try out a different method to retain volume, as I struggle with losing volume on wash day - I did a sort of Praying Hands condition halfway down my hair - but since it's so short currently (sides are ear length while the back almost reaches my neck), I focused mainly on the ends. I then rinsed this out after 15 minutes or so, then reapplied some conditioner to the tips. This really helped to retain some semblance of volume in my har.

Would a leave in conditioner work better for this method?

I am also looking for a gentle shampoo to use once or twice a month so that I can stretch out the time until I use my sulfate shampoo to remove more stubborn build up.

Any recommendations, tips, tricks, etc, would be much appreciated.

Today I decided I just didn't care what it looked like. And so, I washed with all about curls low poo, conditioned with Jessicurl deep conditioner (used like a normal conditioner), and wrung out my hair with my hands. Then combed with a wide tooth comb, followed by a denman brush (nothing fancy, just literally brushed it through my hair) and then scrunched. Let it air dry and when it was almost dry, added some Shea Moisture curl spray (it was a little frizzier than one would like and this tames it).

It's the least work I've put in and the best results I've had.

438,16782,/r/curlyhair/comments/bwp74w/i_got_a_haircut_and_no_one_noticed_day_2/epz5lra/,"I'm pretty proud of it since Ive washed it since the haircut and styled it myself--without a difuser. As much as I would love to hair bigger hair, I just can't see myself putting in the work on a daily basis. If anyone has suggestions for amping the volume on fine, 3a hair, id love to hear some suggestions! I'm 4months into CG.

Wash Day Routine: My hair is prone to dryness so usually day 2 is my best day. On wash day, it's B&amp;B curl shampoo and conditioner. I usually half wash out the conditioner. I then apply a dab on moroccan oil to very wet hair using praying hands. Then, having hair upside down, I add devacurl arc gel (amazing stuff!) using praying hands then scrunch 5-7 times. I then turn my head up and split my hair into two sections and make sure to scrunch the back of my hair as it sometimes doesn't get enough scrunch otherwise. I use a microfiber towel to pick up extra drops, srunching dry at the roots 5 or so times. Once it dries completely, I put my hair upside down and shake out the roots gently and scrunch the dry hair so it's softer curls and more volume. 

Day 2: Spritz my hair with warm water mixed w a dab of conditioner. I then apply an avocado protein cream or B&amp;B leave in conditioner and scrunch slightly. I have to scrunch lightly as otherwise it will frizz. If I see any especially unruly pieces, I twist the strand around my finger.

Every 4 days I rinse my hair with warm water and massage my scalp. I had tried a cowash and it didn’t work well. I don’t know what to do now. See below. 

In the mornings I spray my hair with a water bottle on mist until my hair is damp but not soaking. This is when my hair is curliest. I then use praying hands to add Not Your Mothers Blue Sea Kale Weightless mouse and scrunch = great 3b curls 

I plop for 10-15 min.

Scrunch my hair as I blow dry on med heat low setting. Until mostly dry. 

This is what I have tried that didn’t work: 
•Oils and butters = greasy stringy hair 
•Adding products to my hair when soaking wet = 2c- hair almost straight 
•blow dry with a diffuser on cold/low = lots of frizz
•cowash = flat and almost no waves (soft and healthy looking but almost no curl) used Moptop Citrus Meadly 
•kinky curly spiral spritz = no hold flat hair 
•deva curl frizz Free volumizing foam = dry and stringy curls that didn’t hold 
•I tried a custard that made my hair soft but but no curls 
•air dry = tons of frizz and no volume

452,37127,/r/curlyhair/comments/g5t8n1/alternative_to_deva_curl_products/,"Alternative to Deva Curl ProductsI've been using Deva Curl for over 2 years now, but with everything going on, I'm thinking it's time to switch. I personally haven't really experienced any problems, but I almost feel like it's a ticking time bomb. My hair is already so thin that if I ended up with a bald patch, I'm not sure I'd even be able to cover it.

I've already tried **Bounce Curl, Shea Moisture** (3 different lines), **Tresemme Naturals**, and **Whole Blends** (which may not even be CG friendly???) and I absolutely hated them all. They either dried out my hair, didn't help control frizz, or really weighed down my hair. 

**I'm not really sure what to try next because nothing seems to even come close to Deva Curl. Does anyone have any recommendations?** I'm looking for products that control frizz, help define my curls, and provide some sense of volume (because my hair is so thin). Please help!

Ideally, I'd prefer to stay within one line, but I would be willing to mix and match if that's the only option. 

**Deva Curl Routine that I'd like to replace:**

No-Poo

One Condition 

Super Cream or Styling Cream with Light Defining Gel 

Occasionally I used Mist-er Right and Set It Free for refreshing (though I could definitely live without these). 

**My hair is** **fine, 2C-3B, high porosity(?),** never dyed, and 90% of the time I air dry. 

Thank you for reading all of this and for your recommendations!

453,7581,/r/curlyhair/comments/fdq4cw/fine_hair_wavies_talk_to_me/fjk6xth/,"I have fine 2b/2c hair. I use the tresemme low lather shampoo and the weightless waves conditioner, which gives me tons of slip and moisture while being lightweight. The shampoo makes my scalp feel clean while not being too drying. In the shower I detangle my hair with conditioner, and then squish to condish upside down to get juicy curl clumps. This also helps my hair curl from the root instead of starting halfway down my head.

Growing up, I always had 3a hair, with relatively tight curls in a telephone cord type of curl, with a few looser curls in some areas. In high school I straightened my hair almost every week and used lots of straightening creams and anti-frizz serums that weighed my hair down. Now, in college I have been trying to bring my curls back but I don't know where to start. I use OGX Moroccan Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner, and only wash every 3-4 days. I also use a SheaMoisture deep complex hair mask once a week, and I use Moroccan Argan oil as well as Bedhead Split end mender after washes. I would like to ditch the flat iron - except for rare occasions, and bring out my natural curls, because they look dull, frizzy and kinda flat lately. I just need a good place to start, what products to avoid/use, and any other insightful tips!

I will paste my routine and question again below.

I have checked the FAQ for that list, but was hoping to hear directly from folks here with wins. TY!

Previous post, routine:

Hello curlies and wavies!

I  just discovered this forum and I think it's so funny that I have even  dubbed myself ""secretlycurly"" but only now just discovered there is help  to bring my curls back out of the shadows (I hope)! :-) The reason I  chose that handle is that I used to have great, well-defined waves...  until I was diagnosed with terrible contact allergies to a number of  really common substances (linalool, a plant-derived ingredient in most  fragrances is the worst offender). Since then, I have had to pare down  my product list to nearly nothing. I have spent countless hundreds of  dollars trying various products and breaking out, or trying to home-make  products and ending up with a greasy/oily disaster. About a year ago I  found Jessicurl unscented products and so far (knock on wood) I have had  no eczema reactions from the styling products I use, although I found  the shampoo is a bit harsh and makes my eyelids sting, so I avoid that.  Here is my current routine and products:

1. Wash and condition every other day with Free &amp; Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner
2. Avoid conditioning roots, but let conditioner sit on ends while in shower for about 5 minutes
3. Towel  turban with a regular cotton towel while I dry off, then use a hair  pick to get the tangles out and part my bangs, then scrunch Jessicurl  unscented rockin' ringlets into mostly wet hair. Blowdry bangs only and  let the rest air dry. Sometimes I blowdry bangs first. Sometimes I let  my hair dry more before putting the rockin' ringlets in. Every once in a  while I will try following up the rockin' ringlets with Jessicurl  unscented confident coils, but I often find that it makes my next day  hair extra crispy and unruly.

My  main issue is that my waves are nowhere near as defined as they used to  be, and I feel like my hair is totally dried out and crispy/fuzzy on  the ends (especially on day two) in a way it never was before. I have  not had good luck waking up with second day hair that can be worn out  the door-- I will often wake up to find that it looks like my ends have  been elecrocuted or something. Puffy, frizzy, big, unruly, messy-- hard  to explain. So on the second day I have been using a tapered clipless  curling iron to freshen it up, or sometimes I use a flat iron also.  Reading some of the info here, I am guessing that the crispy ends might  be due to my heat styling without protectant (there is literally nothing  I can use that won't trigger my contact allergies). But, I don't want  to wash my hair every day, and re-applying Jessicurl and/or re-wetting  my hair simply does not work.

**Here's what I'd like to know:**

* Is  the CG routine substantially different for wavies? I worry that  co-washing will make my hair limp and gross since I don't have big  spirals to begin with, but tell me if I'm wrong.... I am willing to try  it if others have seen it work on gentle waves.
* Has  anyone created a CG or wavy routine with ONLY fragrance-free products?  The clarifying shampoos listed are all on my banned list.
* Does  anyone have input on a cut that might enhance my waves the best? I have  tried different variations of side-swept bangs and long layers over the  years as you can see here. It seems that none of the cuts look as good  with the new limited list of products I have to work with. In the olden  days, I was a big fan of Brocato Cloud 9 shampoo/conditioner, Frederick  Fekkai glossing cream, and Bumble and Bumble curl creme. Oh how I miss  those days.

Thanks for input and guidance! I will hopefully soon be openly curly again!",2a,  hello     sorry    post    twice     get    responses     the    collage    posted    earlier  https   www reddit com r curlyhair comments dwgo5p

While I am SO grateful for all the information on here and what is has done for my hair, I am feeling more frustrated with my hair routine than I was before. I have 3a curls and I'm still learning to love them. I've had extensions for the last two years and would straighten my hair or sleep with braids in to try and control my curls. I took my extensions out in November and have been using the CGM since. I do like how defined my curls are, but I'm experiencing two major issues that I have not been able to fix:

1: I have one curl on the right back side of my head that just doesn't know what's going on. It starts to curl in one direction and then flips around somehow and starts curling in the other direction. It creates this weird kink in the middle that I just cannot get rid of. It gets worse with diffusing and can happen to the rest of my hair if I'm not careful. It kind of seems like the curl coils up and the bottom part goes through the top and gets flipped around, but it happens when I air dry too. When I let it coil up in my hands halfway through it just switches direction. I hope that makes sense.

2: I can't believe how time consuming this is! It takes forever for my hair to dry and I just don't have the time to sit and diffuse my hair for 45-60 minutes. It makes me want to go back to blow drying my hair straight and being done in 15 minutes. Diffusing almost makes my curls look worse, but if I skip it my hair stays wet for hours. I don't know what to do, I'm just tired of wasting so much time.

Routine: cowash with tresemme every 4-5 days, use cantu curl activator and herbal essences gel, plop, diffuse with the xtava, scrunch. Products work well for me. Curls look nicer when I air dry. I have to rewet it completely everyday, haven't figured out any other way to have nice second day curls.

Is everyone else spending hours on their hair? Is it really any healthier than straightening it if I'm applying heat with my blow dryer for almost an hour?

Though I can't really help with the frizz situation as I didn't have my hair cut that short (and I still can't control my own frizz to save my life), I can confirm that it will get better with time. When she cut my hair, she continuously combed it out with a fine tooth comb in order to keep it straight, which essentially destroyed my curl pattern. I naturally have 3a curls, but after that haircut my hair looked closer to a 2b. But now, after it's grown out for some months, my curls are starting to form again and my hair looks a lot better.

471,26092,/r/curlyhair/comments/dmjba2/please_help_me_find_a_shampoo_and_figure_out_my/,"Please help me find a shampoo and figure out my curl typeI have what I think is fine hair with regular porosity. The very very ends are the only part that’s been processed. I thought before starting anything that my hair might be 2a with some 2b but now I have no idea what’s going on. I ask because I see some people say waves and curls can require slightly different care and when I research products articles group the products by either curl type or curls vs waves. I have ringlets but some pieces on the very top of bottom will be loose waves. So if anyone has hair like mine or can tell me what curl type I have so I don’t mess my hair up by accident please help me lol.

Also I see devacurl recommended constantly and I’d love to use it but right now I just really don’t have the money. Can anyone recommend an affordable drug store(idk Walmart or target or something too) shampoo and conditioner that’s curly girl friendly and won’t weigh my hair down. My hair seems fine so I’m kind of worried that if I use really popular curly hair products that they’ll be too heavy but when I play it safe it never feels like it’s moisturizing enough... So if you have hair like mine please tell me what you’ve found works for you that won’t empty my bank account. I’m a dog walker in college if that gives you the right idea.

My hair 2 days later after refreshing: 

 https://imgur.com/RwUgbri (sorry it's weirdly blurry. I shattered my phone screen and a crack went right over the camera. this is another reason I'm trying save money lol bad timing)

My routine so far:

\-I wash my hair with OGX coconut oil shampoo. I used to just use it on my scalp but since I’m using mousse and gel now I wash all my hair (is that okay?)

\-I squish to condish with OGX coconut miracle oil. I might be rinsing too much of the clumping out because I don’t think leaving OGX conditioner in my hair would be a good idea so I’m being cautious and rinsing it all out while still squishing it and hoping its still making a difference

\-I scrunch my hair with garnier totally twisted mousse and plop it. I haven’t been using gel right out of the shower recently because the first time I must have done something wrong because it didn’t come out very good but I think I’ve got the hang of it so I might do that on wash day too now idk.

\-I plop my hair in a shirt for like an hour and take it down to air dry.

\-I've been pineappling overnight. Plopping overnight made my roots really flat.

Refresh:

\-I wet my hair and scrunch with totally twisted mousse and Aussie instant freeze sculpting gel. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know OGX isn’t curly girl approved and a lot of people seem to have issues with it so I want to use something else but like I said I can’t afford Devacurl and I keep reading that shea moisture weighs down type 2 hair and I thought OGX was great but I guess not so now I’m really at a loss lol. Also if you read my routine and think I could do something better please tell me. I’m a only a couple washes in and still figuring things out.

I am flirting with the idea of shaving my head, I always wanted a short hair and have been cutting it shorter every year. I think my hair is between 3a and 3b, depending on the day, and when I was little it was a 3c. I love my curls and want that 3c again, but I know it is almost impossible, but I'm afraid that after shaving I will lose more of my curls.

474,27871,/r/curlyhair/comments/bwthrf/unusual_hair_routines/,"Unusual hair routines?Hello,

I have low porosity 2b-2c hair and it takes up to four or five hours to hair dry (2 or 3 if I diffuse my roots. I never diffuse my ends because it makes my hair frizzy.) I’m looking to cut my drying time. 

I wash my hair every other day because I get stink fast. (I don’t work out, but once I start exercising regularly I will wash my hair everyday. This is just a personal preference. I don’t apply shampoo to my ends, so they don’t get dried out.) I currently use SM shampoo, suave coconut conditioner, then style with garnier leave in (I use the avocado mask as a leave in because it’s extremely lightweight) and the garnier jelly. I style in the shower right after rinsing out my conditioner. 

Has anyone with low porosity tried conditioning first and then shampooing? How does it work out? I’m thinking of trying it and styling after t-shirt plopping. That way I could use less product, which would possibly cut my drying time.

477,1518,/r/curlyhair/comments/bntwvf/help_with_very_low_porosity_fine_waves/en9gwr6/,"I'm no expert as I just realized my hair is legitimately wavy and not just poofy about two months ago. But I also have 2a/2b, fine, low porosity hair, so maybe I can help.

So first off, do you ever do a clarifying wash? I know it's kind of a no-no with the CGM, but my hair is weighed down super easily, so I use a sulfate shampoo about once a week. After my first reset wash, I wasn't going to use it again, but my hair started looking straighter and greasy after just a couple weeks, so I added it back in on a weekly basis.

I also notice that if I use the praying hands method, my waves look really stringy and sad, so I just scrunch my mousse/gel in without smoothing it over praying hands style. I think the praying hands method is more important for people who have curlier hair that scrunching the product into wouldn't work to coat the entire clump. Since waves are more open than ringlets, it's not a big deal.

It could be a protein thing, but my experience with protein is that it's *way way way* easy to overload on when you have low porosity hair because it's essentially coating your hair to strengthen it and we don't have very many nooks and crannies on our strands for it to sit in. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong about that though!

I hope that helps somewhat... Like I said, I'm a little new at this!

478,9795,/r/curlyhair/comments/acxix0/is_a_devacut_worth_it/edc0g4o/,"In my opinion, it depends on how good the hairstylist is. I’ve had two Deva cuts done by two different stylists, both with a Deva rank of 1, and one was pretty shitty and the other amazing.

So I have dirty blonde, high density, fine, low porosity hair that is 2C-3B; the length was down to my middle back (most recently I cut it to just grazing my shoulders). So whenever I cut my hair, I NEED layers in it or it will poof to a triangle and knot like a son of a bitch. 

The bad stylist seemed like she was listening, but seemed inexperienced and confused that I wanted layers. She cut a little bit of hair, then washed/conditioned with Deva Curl, used light defining gel and then cut the rest. I ended up with a section of hair shorter than the rest, I didn’t notice this until a few weeks later. She also couldn’t explain her styling process to me so I could recreate it at home. She didn’t even cut off that much hair, and my hair ended up being harder to care for. She seemed like she was just following a template and didn’t know how to adjust it for my needs. 

The amazing stylist made me feel like I was the center of her world. She talked to me about what my hair was like and how I dealt with it, then she applied clarifying shampoo for an hour under heat, rinsed it, showed me how to style it and dryed it, then cut it exactly like I wanted it. She gave me so many layers and I love it! Because I ended up cutting so much off, she then rewetted it and styled it (she actually made me do it with guidance from her) to make sure it looked good. Throughout my appointment, she explained the science of why she did what she did (which I loved because I was a chemistry student in college), she showed me a hair routine/products that work for my hair and it is so much faster to do. And she showed me how to use gel effectively for my hair.

My advice is, ask around for a good stylist, see if they have pictures of their work up on social media to confirm that they actually know what they are doing. A good Deva stylist should listen to you, know how to deal with your hair type in terms of washing/conditioning/styling/cutting, and show you how to wash/condition/style your hair so it looks good.

* S2C leave-in (Miss Jessie's Leave-in Condish) - this is a new addition to my routine but find it helps with the tangles I get near the crown of my head and helps curl clumps form. I do this with my hair upside down

In 2007, banana peel powder was tested as a means of filtration for heavy metals and radionuclides occurring in water produced by the nuclear and fertilizer industries (cadmium contaminant is present in phosphates). When added and thoroughly mixed for 40 minutes, the powder can remove roughly 65% of heavy metals, and this can be repeated.

488,31437,/r/curlyhair/comments/dxj5gr/sos_curly_hair_routine_is_getting_out_of_control/,"SOS Curly hair routine is getting out of control. Please adviseHi lovely curlies! I could desperately use some of your sage advice. This is a bit long so please bear with me. My current curly hair routine is getting out of control and I'm (quite literally) losing sleep over it. 

For context, I decided to embrace my very fine 2b/2c curls a few months ago after straightening them to hell for over 10 years with the hope that going natural would save me time getting ready for work in the morning. After steeping myself in all manner of curly hair routine youtube videos and the information in this sub, I have landed on the following morning hair routine:

1. Wash my hair with Tresseme Keratin shampoo + conditioner. On days that I don't wash it, I just get it wet in the shower.
2. Apply Aveda Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair leave-in conditioner and comb through with a dolman brush to distribute evenly
3. Scrunch Oway Curl Serum below the midshaft.
4. Spray hair with water to get my curls to clump after brushing them
5. Scrunch a generous amount of gel to create a gel cast on wet hair.
6. Let air dry for an hour while applying face creams + makeup
7. Diffuse until mostly dry
8. At this point, I'll go in with a flatiron to curl some of the straight strands in the top layer of my hair to make it match the rest of my curls
9. Apply smoothing serum to tame the remaining frizz

In total, this takes me 2.5 hours every morning and I have to wake up at 5:30 am to get this done and get to work on time. Waking up at the crack of dawn to make sure my hair looks halfway decent before I leave the house is leaving me chronically sleep-deprived.  Not to mention, this is not what I was hoping would happen when I decided to embrace my curls in the hope of saving time. 

Do any of you have any advice on how I could simplify my hair routine to get the sleep that I so desperately need? What does your curly hair routine look like and how long does it take?

492,23208,/r/curlyhair/comments/c8audu/help_southern_climate_w_northerner_hair/esmposk/,"Deva is full of glycerin. Some people's hair loves glycerin and does well with it. Some people can only use it under ideal weather conditions. Some people don't do well with it anytime. I can't use glycerin in dry, cold weather or humid weather. It turns into a frizzy, moist poof or a crispy dry mess, depending on the weather. When it's good, it's great, but in Upstate New York, the conditions are hardly ever ideal for me to get good results with products that have glycerin high up on the ingredient list.

Also, you might not need as many moisturizing ingredients in hot, humid weather. I've been in Florida this time of year, it was unpleasantly hot and humid, and rained everyday. The water in Florida is notoriously hard.

Stop at Walmart or a drug store and get a cheap gel or mousse without glycerin. Aussie Instant Freeze, Suave Max Hold gel, Pantene and Suave both have CG-friendly mousses without glycerin. Also, pick up a bottle of cheap Suave Daily clarifying shampoo. The buildup buster doesn't have the ingredients necessary to remove hard water.

When I went to Florida last year, I used a sulfate shampoo, a cheap VO5 conditioner, the same John Frieda spray and some mousse from Pantene. Had the best hair of my life despite being in Florida during record-breaking rain and winds (which for Florida is some shit!).

I have quite fine hair thats always flat and looked dry. due to heat, bleach and normal products it never looked good. It's slowly getting better but I'd still love tips on how to improve what I have going right now :) 

Current Routine (I wash my hair every 4-5days):
Co-Wash with Guhl Feuchtigkeitsaufbau Pflegespülung, comb it while in the shower, I leave around 80% of it in. After that I scrunch with  a bit of syoss max hold power gel and balea trend it up verlockendes mousse. Today I tried plopping for the first time I usually don't do that (not too sure if it helped) and yeah then I let it air dry :) 

I'd love to get more volume and definition, I feel like one side of my head is already pretty nice and the other is just lacking also the bottom layer of my hair in the back just doesn't seem to curl at all and for some reason never gets a gel cast even if I put extra gel on it. I'd be ready to cut if I have to any other tips would also be amazing.

495,20535,/r/curlyhair/comments/aqjkta/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_feb_14_2019/egi7lz7/,"Hey! So I've been using the CG method for a couple of weeks now, and I'm having trouble with gel. I can't seem to scrunch out the crunch very well. After scrunching my hair gets thin, stringy curls and I can never get all the crunch out. Without gel my curls are much fuller and I have some big ringlets throughout, but they don't last. I think my hair type is 3A, maybe 3B. According to the quiz provided it's low porosity. I've tried different amounts of gel, from a small palmful to a  big handful and it doesn't seem to make a difference. It's the LA Looks blue gel. Maybe I'm applying it wrong or scrunching wrong? I usually do the praying hands thing that seems to work for most curlies, I've tried it with my head upside down and right side up. Plop for 20 minutes, wait till it's dry, scrunch with a t shirt. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or why it's not working for me. Any advice?

Also, my routine is literally just what you see in the new curlies post. Co wash and condition with Tresemme Botanique. I'm still pretty new to this so it's not set in stone, if anyone has any recommendations for different products I'm open to trying them.

She also has a vid talking about hair porosity with a lot more detail and more technical version than just low/medium/high porosity. She also has 3a-3c high porosity fine hair too and has a lot of great info.

Personally I struggle a lot with flat and limp 2b-2c fine high porosity hair too, and though I'm new to the journey what's definitely helped is diffusing upside down, using less product, not using products with heavy coconut oil, castor or jojoba and other oils, glycerin too. Moisture and protein overloading can also cause a lot of the problems you talk about, so balancr is key. Researching dew points and how hair changes during the season changes could also help. A lot of people struggle with season changes since your hair needs change with the transition of season changes. I'd also recommend researching what ingredients do to your hair so you can avoid using products with ingredients that might making the problems with your hair right now.

Hi! I've recently started to embrace my curls after more than 10 years of straightening. I don't know if I'll be able to go back to what it used to be when I was a kid but I'm willing to try everything. I think I'm a wavy, probably curl type 2A/2B?

I came across this sub recently and I'm trying to build a routine but the only products I was able to find here are the *Tresemme  Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish* (the one with the coconut) and the *V05 Clarifying Shampoo* (the package is slightly differente, like the one here is an older one but I'll check the ingredients at the supermarket to see if it's the same). 

I'm trying to find a gel or mousse but none of the ones of the list are available here. **What ingredients should I avoid in gels or mousses?** I've found ones with parabens and silicones but those are a no-no. There's another from Tresemme which I pasted the ingredients to check if it was CG approved with caution since it has humectants. And this mousse: *Moroccanoil Curl Control Mousse* \- CG approved with cautions due to proteins and polyquats.

TL;DR: What ingredients should I avoid in gels or mousses? Has anyone tried hair wax or those are not recommended?
