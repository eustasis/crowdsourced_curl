Since moving to a hard water area (I live in work housing so no option to get water softener) things have been pretty rough, especially now that winter is in full swing. My hair is 2b/2c, relatively long, low porosity, dense. I got a balayage about a year and a half ago so the bottom 1/2 or so is dyed/bleached and has a lot of split ends.

I recently tried Olaplex 3 because I'm trying to avoid cutting my hair (I know I need to eventually but I‚Äôm saving up for a Deva cut) and I feel like it helped with the damaged ends a bit. However, I'm still having trouble getting any volume at my crown, and I get NO gel cast with any gel I've used, and my waves become limp after a day or so. Also, my hair gets incredibly tangled very easily. I'm pretty sure my hair is protein sensitive because when I used to use the Deva Curl Ultra Defining gel it got super strawlike/crunchy, but my hair has been very dry/brittle at the ends recently. I tried the Ultra Defining gel again and suddenly my hair is soft again so maybe I do need protein sometimes??  My theory is because the dyed sections of my hair are higher porosity since they're bleached (?) and so were suffering from lack of protein? Does that seem right?


Help with any of these problems would be appreciated!  Here's my current routine (can't quite do cg because I get buildup super easily especially with hard water now):

* Wash with Ion clarifying shampoo every 2 weeks or so, otherwise wash with TJ's tea tree oil shampoo (or, currently experimenting with SM JBCO shampoo to add some protein into routine). I have tried cowashing with TJ‚Äôs conditioner and it did not work for me. 
* condition with Tresemme Botanique coconut/aloe (RIP my love Tresemme Perfectly Undone). Brush hair with conditioner in, squish to condish, leave some in. (sometimes I use TJ tea tree conditioner, not sure which I like better yet) 
* apply a LOT of gel to wet hair -- I ran out of Aussie Freeze so I'm trying Garnier Curl Scrunch. Recently broke out the Deva Curl bottle again with aforementioned results. I've tried both praying hands and scrunching in gel and neither seems to really make a difference.
* Plop for like 20 mins usually. More if I forget. I find that sleeping on my hair wet makes the curls way more defined? But I try not to do that cause it makes my scalp itchy. If anyone knows the reasoning behind this let me know!
* (sometimes) diffuse partway if I have time. I tried diffusing all the way dry one time and it made a big difference with curls/volume but I don't have time to do that because my hair takes FOREVER to dry. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/FQ3OmXZ) are some pictures I‚Äôve taken that kind of explain what I was talking about. I'm experimenting with root clipping currently (with the O method I saw in some video) and it doesn't seem to have made a difference so far--I've tried putting them in both before and after plopping/diffusing. Got a silk pillowcase, seems to be helping with frizz but not really wave definition. What else can I try? I‚Äôm not sure if maybe my hair is just getting too long and therefore weighing itself down, but I‚Äôve always had problems with volume around my crown‚Äîit‚Äôs just gotten worse recently.

I shower every day, and used to shampoo and conditioner my hair every day as well.  I am trying to see how far I can go now that I am using CG products in not shampooing my hair without it being grungy.

27937,/r/curlyhair/comments/c334cz/i_cant_make_my_curls_look_nice/,"I can't make my curls look niceHi all!  I am going to apologize in advance for the rant, but I am a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not new to the curly girl method by any means.  I have been trying it off and on for the past 3 years or so, but I am still not satisfied with my hair.  I have tried everything from As I am to Kevin Murphy to Deva Curl to Carol's Daughter.  I have thick hair, but the hair itself is fine.  My curl type is somewhere between 2B to 2C - it is flat and frizzy on top, the ends go everywhere.  It is very low-porosity.  It has never been colored, and it has minimal heat styling.  I really just need some insight from people who might have hair like mine because I just want to chop it all off or go back to straightening it every day like when I was a teen.  I'll go through some of the routines I have tried...

&amp;#x200B;

* Conditioner Wash:  I tried Deva Curl in the past, but it left my hair feeling very dry and filmy.  I have also tried Shea Moisture, Kevin Murphy, Unite, and Carol's daughter with the same issues.  I am now using As I am cowash, but while my hair isn't dry and filmy, it weighs the curls down so much that I end up have...almost straight but unflattering bumpy hair?  I spend a lot of time washing it out, so I don't think it is that I am not rinsing well enough.  I have tried both combs and just fingers with similar results.  Squishing makes the unflattering bumpy 'straight' hair even worse.  My hair always looks best after the clarifying shampoo plus co-wash.  I tend to do this step about every 3 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

* Styling:  I tried to go to a curly only stylist to see if they could help me apply product appropriately.  I have used Deva Curl's lightweight gel, Kevin Murphy's killer curls, Shea Moisture's curl enhancing smoothie and Miss Jellie's jelly soft curls.    When I run gel or cream through my hair completely as taught by the stylist (and seen on sites), I lose the 'frizz' but I also lose all definition of my curls (even after plopping and scrunching and applying the product while my hair is still very wet - my curls just do not come back).  It just makes my hair look piecy and dirty.  Two stylists that do only curly hair were at a loss as to what to do with my hair after this happened with them.  However, if I put gel in my hands and scrunch without distributing thoroughly, I get beautiful ringlets on the bottom, but a halo of atrocious frizz on top. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Drying:  I always use a microfiber towel to scrunch afterwards.  Air drying vs. diffusing doesn't make much of a difference. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried deep conditioning treatments, but I don't see much of a difference in my hair.  I avoid touching it to decrease the frizz.  I sleep on a silk pillow.  But I constantly either have moisturized but clumpy/undefined hair or pretty ringlets at the bottom, but dry hair that has a layer of frizz blowing in the wind on top.  And reviving it on day two with either conditioner/water or a product meant to revive (Carol's daughter hair milk I think?) it doesn't revive the hair...just makes it clumpy and gross.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to love my hair, but I also want to give up after trying for such a long time.  It is so stinking expensive to go to curly salons where they can't figure out my hair along with spending all of this money on products that don't make a difference.  I look at my office mates curly hair, and at all of the photos here, and it makes me so sad.

I've googled my issue to death but can't find an answer to this!

My hair for some reason can't be flipped upside down or even really go side to side. I see videos of people turning their heads at all angles while conditioning/applying products/plopping with ease--their hair just magically goes in the direction they turn their head.

When I do it, my hair immediately tangles and becomes stringy. I cant do my routine upside down to encourage volume because when i try to plop or turn right side up it is a rats nest. I have also found that I can't scrunch at **any point** in the process because it makes it frizzy and destroys the clumps. It's just like my hair all sticks together and wants to stay that way.

It has just left me really unsatisfied with my hair. Its flat and limp and frizzy. I'll try to include a picture in the comments. 

**Anyone else have similar hair, and what have you done to improve your routine? I would really like to have more volume/body without making frizz and stringiness. Thanks!**

My hair I think is 2b/2c and very fine, with fragile curls. 

Products: 

* cowash with cozykids cowash (was on clearance at target and seems to work!)
* clarify biweeklyish with nym honey and melon shampoo or deeply moisturizing tale and mane
* condish with shae moisture restore and repair
* leave-in is shae moisture Jamaican black castor oil (i thought it would be too heavy for my hair but it doesn't seem to be causing any issues.)
* volumizing sauve mousse (I've tried gels but they make my hair feel dry and very tangly)

I do all this right side up with gentle praying hands, and try to encourage curls/clumping by pressing the ends of my hair into my scalp. No scrunching!

I comb my hair with the denman brush after the leave in and mousse for product distribution. Seems to make the mousse work better. I've tried sectioning my hair and combing individual clumps but because of these issues I can't manage to grab one clump without surrounding hairs and clumps going with it and its just a mess! 

Thanks again!

My curls look their best after I use a clarifying shampoo (only used every month or so) followed by a lot of conditioner, add more conditioner after getting out of the shower, then comb out the knots/part it, scrunch up, let my hair air dry for 15 minutes, softly scrunch with a cotton shirt to pull excess water, and then apply gel, let dry, and end with scrunching out the crunch about 2 hours later. 

This last week I almost got it to a point where day two *could* be okay if I wasn't working that day and didn't have to pull off a professional look. Still, that's progress from looking like a mess before the end of the day!

4174,/r/curlyhair/comments/a1vcr2/seeing_great_results_but_confused_about_protein/easzvik/,"After spending wayyyy too much $$ on products when I first started the CG routine, I am finally settling into what I think is working okay so far. But it's still not quite perfect. 

My routine is kind of a mishmash of things that have little rhyme or reason currently (I'm still learning) but right now I cleanse with sulfate/silicone-free shampoo about once a week (Nature's Gate). In between that I use DevaCurl No-Poo (until I use it all up, as it's not my favorite) and condition with GVP Conditioning Balm, leaving a little in my hair as a leave-in when I rinse. If my hair is feeling especially dry, I'll also add in a touch of Garnier Whole Blends Legendary Olive Leave-In (again, until I use it up, as it seems a bit too heavy for my hair, so not my favorite). I follow that up with LA Looks Extreme Sport gel, scrunch it up, let it air dry for a bit and then scrunch out the crunch. If I need a little more body (which I typically do), I'll spritz in a touch of GVP Volumizing Root Lifter, which adds some body and texture without making it crunchy or gross feeling. 

My wavy hair really is looking SO much better than what my hair looked like before, when I thought I just had frizzy, poofy, unmanageable STRAIGHT hair hah. But it does still feel a bit dry, is prone to some frizz (tho the LA Looks is helping a LOT with that. I previously used DevaCurl Light Defining Gel and am not a fan of it), breaks way more than I'd like it to, and could use more body/curl definition sometimes, without it feeling all weighed down by conditioners. 

So, my question is about protein treatments. I do know that my hair is high-porosity, especially since I have it professionally colored every 6-8 weeks. I'm wondering if a protein treatment would help the overall look and feel of my hair. If so, how often should I use it? Any products that work especially well for medium-thickness, high-porosity, 2b/2c waves (I think? lol)? Anything else I might want to add to my routine?

Hello! I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep a long story short but I‚Äôm about 3 months into CG and not loving the results (more so because of the cut and some pesky bangs) but I‚Äôm confident this just needs more time. 

I guess you could say I‚Äôm ‚Äòtransitioning‚Äò still as my roots are FAR curlier than my ends are. The image is a few days after wash so it‚Äôs a lot more settled and stretched out than on wash day. I‚Äôd say roots and underside (the most virgin areas of my head) are a 2c-3a while the ends fall more into 2b-2c, and sometimes even a flat 2a. 

I recently tried a protein treatment for the first time which my hair LOVED, it made the waves at the ends so much more shiny and defined, and way less frizz. But it also made my root curl pattern much stronger... ultimately highlighting the difference in curl patterns throughout my hair. 

At this point I‚Äôm really trying to minimise the look of curly roots and straight ends and have been almost stretching and laying my roots as flat as possible, tucking it behind my ears, etc., while still scrunching the ends to even out the texture but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding the right balance!

Would it make any sense to treat the roots differently to the ends by maybe adding moisture up top and protein at the bottom? 

Does anyone have any tips for the transition period that aren‚Äôt about ways to tie it back? I‚Äôd really like to avoid all of the progress in curl memory ‚Äòtraining‚Äô by pulling it into buns and braids that could disrupt that... 

Lastly, I don‚Äôt mind stretched out waves/curls at all (I even prefer day 2 hair most times after it‚Äôs settled down) and my goal isn‚Äôt volume up top so I‚Äôm happy to sacrifice definition and/or volume for just a more uniform, tame look! 

**ROUTINE**

I switch it up constantly as I get a little desperate for something to work but am currently home for holidays so it has forced me to stick to these few products and really test properly... 

1. **Burts Bees More Moisture Shampoo** Don‚Äôt have anything to say about this really. As a wavy my hair really doesn‚Äôt mind a light shampoo. I use a scalp massager to work it in and then fully rinse. I have As I Am Coconut Cowash waiting for me for when I finish up this bottle though. 
2. **Noughty Intensive Care Conditioner** STC. Again just kind of using this up as I neither like nor dislike it. Have tried both upside down and right side up but really can‚Äôt decide what works better. Hair is only shoulder length so it doesn‚Äôt fall back down nicely once I flip upright and the roots go absolutely wild. Equally, it lays a little too flat against my head if I do it all right side up. Have been experimenting more recently with tipping my head side to side and doing it parallel to the ground. This is working okay... 
3. **Pantene No. 5 Mousse** I THINK I really like this but again, I can never tell what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. I keep using it though so I think instinctively it works for me? I focus this on the ends. 
4. **Aussie Instant Freeze Gel** This is also good I think, I was using another that didn‚Äôt have protein in it and tons of glycerin but after the protein revelation I switched to this. 
5. Microfibre microplop to get excess moisture/product out
6. Manipulate fringe/ roots that have gone a little too crazy
7. Air-dry \~70% (or as long as I can wait as it takes easily 5 hours to get to this point) and then sometimes diffuse the rest of the way. SOTC. 

**TL;DR**

Roots are way too curly compared to the rest of my hair and I‚Äôd like to minimise cowlicks and volume up top, and get the texture to behave while I grow it out.",2b,moisture v protein different texture root v end curl mixed fine fairly dense porosity tbc take eon dry actually get wet quickly hold product fairly easily normal porosity protein happy processing img sosgl2p8f5741 hello m going best long story short m 3 month loving result pesky bang m confident need time guess say m transitioning root far curlier end image day wash s settled stretched wash day d say root underside virgin area head end fall flat recently tried protein treatment time hair loved wave end shiny defined way frizz root curl pattern stronger ultimately highlighting difference curl pattern hair point m trying minimise look curly root straight end stretching laying root flat possible tucking ear scrunching end texture m having hard time finding right balance sense treat root differently end adding moisture protein doe tip transition period aren t way tie d like avoid progress curl memory training pulling bun braid disrupt lastly t mind stretched wave curl prefer day 2 hair time s settled goal isn t volume m happy sacrifice definition volume uniform tame look switch constantly little desperate currently home holiday forced stick product test properly 1 burt bee moisture shampoo t say wavy hair doesn t mind light shampoo use scalp massager fully rinse coconut cowash waiting finish bottle 2 noughty intensive care conditioner stc kind like dislike tried upside right t decide work better hair shoulder length doesn t fall nicely flip upright root absolutely wild equally lay little flat head right experimenting recently tipping head doing parallel ground working okay 3 pantene 5 mousse like tell s working isn t instinctively work focus end 4 aussie instant freeze gel good didn t protein ton glycerin protein revelation switched 5 microfibre microplop excess moisture product 6 manipulate fringe root gone little crazy 7 air dry 70 long wait take easily 5 hour point diffuse rest way sotc tl dr root way curly compared rest hair d like minimise cowlick volume texture behave grow,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Morning/Nighttime Routines,Drying Methods,Moisturizing and Deep Treatments

I shower every morning to do my hair. Cleansing every 3+days. Conditioning every day. Gel every day. Air dry. 

I feel good about the outcomes mostly, but I can‚Äôt get close to what they did at the salon. Once I get to Day 2 or 3, my hair looks okay, but starts to feel very dry &amp; crunchy. 

I have 3b/3c hair. Not sure on porosity. 

I think the next step is to adjust the product I use &amp; to be better at hydrating my hair in the conditioning stage. Also wanting to get into a routine of deep conditioning every week or two.

Raw Curls - after a month I sold the rest to my coworker. It's beautiful for her, it was terrible for my hair and left it mushy mess.

Growing up, I had full, crazy curly hair. Around 3B in most places, with some larger 3A sections thrown in. Then I moved, and the combination of a new, aggressively dry environment with super hard water, and the diagnosis of an aggravated autoimmune condition somehow just... stole it. Literally, I would let my hair air dry, and all my curl was gone. Maybe 2A at most when it was out of control. It was hard, but I adjusted, and dealt with the new hair cards I‚Äôd been handed. Finally, 6 years later, I have a bit more of a handle on my autoimmune situation, I‚Äôve moved into a place with a water softener, and I‚Äôve started using super moisturizing products that were, coincidentally, mostly CG approved. Lo and behold, my curl is coming back!

It‚Äôs not the same as it used to be, still changing, mostly hovering around 2C. But considering my haircut is fully geared towards straight hair, I figured it would be a good idea to chat with someone who is a curl expert to kinda guide me through the transition back to (hopefully!) my old hair. I found a lady through recommendations of friends, and we had a pretty in depth conversation via Instagram messaging. She was a ‚Äúredken curl expert‚Äù, knew I was only looking for a consultation, and that I‚Äôve had pretty traumatizing experiences in the past with stylists not listening and having my hair just chopped. She agreed that it would just be a free, 30 minute consultation regarding hair goals and suggestions, and that I could then take the time to decide what I want from there. Important to note, while I absolutely love my curls, I need to have my hair a certain way for my job. Since I never know what I‚Äôm getting while things are changing back, I‚Äôve had to do a slow CG transition, and continue styling with a curling wand etc until I‚Äôm able to figure out how to make the style work with my natural curls.

Yesterday was my ‚Äúconsultation‚Äù. We were sitting in the stylist chairs facing each other (not the mirrors!) when she mentioned something about knowing what I meant and needing to get her hands into it to figure out the texture. So she jumps behind me, starts feeling away, says she knows exactly what we need to do, and then I hear it.

*SNIP*

Long story short, she went rogue. My ‚Äúfree consultation‚Äù turned into a $90 haircut. At least 6 inches are gone. I was shell shocked, and didn‚Äôt know what to do or say, and the last person you want to piss off is the lady who‚Äôs got scissors to your head and has already started things you didn‚Äôt want. Most confusingly? She styled it straight when she was done. I walked in there with hair to the middle of my chest, even when wearing it with my natural curl. I walked out with hair that just brushes my shoulders when straight. 

I haven‚Äôt washed her styling out yet. I‚Äôm too scared to. I know it‚Äôs ‚Äújust hair‚Äù and it‚Äôll grow back, but this was not what I was ready for. I‚Äôm scared to see how my hair looks with the natural curl. If she didn‚Äôt even listen to the part about, you know, NOT CUTTING MY HAIR, I‚Äôm worried too that she didn‚Äôt even listen to my needs regarding my curls. What started as what I thought would be my first steps into getting my curl back and embracing my natural look, has turned into me terrified to even wash it to see what she did.

Maybe you have loose waves that lose their shape after a couple of days. I have mostly 2c curls with some 3a ringlets, and the third or fourth day some of them look like 2a waves. Some ringlets are still there, but I have to put my hair in a bun (since refreshing doesn't really do it for me).
The thing is, no one can tell you what method to use and what not to use. Forget that it's called curly girl method. It works for you, makes your hair healthier and gives you some waves that you enjoy without the need to damage your hair (after all the reason we're not using curling irons is because they damage the hair, otherwise it would be amazing for those bad hair days).

I would skip the co-wash. Find a good low-poo. Giovanni Smooth as Silk is my favorite. I didn't like the Tresemme conditioner. It was oddly heavy but not moisturizing. VO5 has some cheap, lightweight options. The matching Giovanni conditioner is also nice and light.

I can't leave any regular conditioner in my hair. I rinse it all out and a light leave-in, also Giovanni.

Your hair looks fine, fine hair tends to not like heavy oils and butters. I cut down on products with heavy oils and butters and switched out for products that had no or light amounts of lighters oils. I still use oil to pre-poo, but always follow oiling with a low-poo or clarifying wash.

I can't apply products to soaking wet hair. It drags my 2c-3c curls down. I scrunch some water out with a t-shirt, then apply products. I usually need less leave-in and gel doing it this way as well.

Diffusing on medium heat can sometimes help enhance and encourage curls. My hair take way too long to dry and turns into a frizzy, much less defined mess if I air dry. I'm also low porosity, that tends to increase my hairs tendency for liking heat.

Personally, while I like the Aussie Instant Freeze, use it, and have backups waiting, I do notice that it tends to give me a more elongated curl pattern. Even when I emulsify it with water (also very helpful when I learned that trick for gel application!), it's thick and tends to pull my curls into a wavier pattern. Uncle Funky's Curly Magic does the same thing. Sometimes I like that look. LA Looks Nutra Curl gel and the Suave Max Hold gel give me the springiest curls, with the Suave winning between the two. It is a thick gel, try applying small amounts emulsified in  warm water to help distribute.

Also, not hair related in the slightest, but you have a lovely complexion!

I've read that ppl get soft hair after scrunching out the crunch when using gel... that's not the case for me? It does look soft, but touching it feels greasy. Especially after sleeping on it, it's quite disgusting to touch... and also looks we. But gel does give me better definition!

I'm a wavy 2a-2b, I think normal to low porosity (takes ~6hrs to dry with products in). I co-wash, condition, rinse most of it out and the apply gel. I've tried both on dripping wet and damp hair... my hair doesn't get greasy when I don't use gel. 

I've tried 2 different gels that seem to be well-liked where I am. But both gave me the same greasy feel... Haven't tried the recommended ones in this subreddit bc I'm not in the US.

I tell the front desk lady who I want to make it with.

Her: Do you want it also blow dried and straightened?

 Sometimes I get it straightened and whatnot, but I told her I just wanted the person to give a trim this time. 

Her: Are you going to straighten it beforehand? 
Me: No.
Her: (raises eyebrows) Really because she only trims it while straightened.
Me: No, she's done it before I should be fine.
Her: (eyebrows still raised) Well alright.

(Background: I'm trasitioning. My hair isn't damaged. It's always been strong and healthy. Currently I just wear a low bun and a fashionable hat within the growing process... I have different textures so it looks weird lol).But since the hat gets tiring, I do straighten it once every few months. I know some people's hair gets damaged easily with an iron, but trust me it'll take a lot of muscle if you'd want to damage hair that is as strong as mine. Overall I'm enjoying the process. The curls get looser as they grow so it's neat to watch it all happen. Right now I can assume I'm 3a or just thick loose curls in general)

Let me just say, I'm upset. The way she rose her eyebrows, what do you think it's impossible to trim wavy and curly hair?!

The person I wanted to get my hair trimmed with, I wouldn't her trust it to style once it grows out. I saw a curly girl come in once and she didn't look like she knew what she was doing.

Like, what do they teach you at beauty schools? Anyone can learn to straighten hair with YouTube videos.

 If it was the 80s and I tell her I wasnt getting a perm, would she still raise her eyebrows at me?

Seriously, beauty schools should teach them how to embrace your hair and enchance it. Teach girls with straight hair to achieve volume without heat. Teach curly girls to reduce frizz without heat. 

It's not bad to grab the straightener once in a while to switch things up (if you're not doing it consistently and are focused on taking care of your curls, more power to you)

But that doesn't have to be the only choice. It's possible to enchance your wavy, curly hair with proper guidance.

1. My hair sits somewhere between 2b and 3c. The left side of my head is definitely more wavy (2b) and the right side of my head gets proper ringlets (3c). It constantly looks like I just slept on the left side of my head. Does anyone have suggestions on how to get a more consistent curl type all the way around? Should I be using completely different styling products on one side?
2. I'm struggling with halo frizz. My hair was chronically dry for a long time (I dried and straightened it daily for nearly 16 years), but well into month 2 of CG and it's getting better. But with summer coming, I know the humidity is only going to make the frizz worse. I've been reading all morning, and I plan to try cooler water and avoiding standing directly under the showerhead as much as possible, but if anyone has other suggestions, it would be appreciated!
3. No volume at roots :(. I've tried remedying this by doing everything upside down, but I've found that adding product and drying exclusively upside creates a really funky curl pattern once I'm right-side up. If anyone has drying techniques or product recommendations for crown volume, I'd love to hear it.

My current CG routine:
Full wet every two days, alternating between co-wash (Suave essentials - I went for cheap on my first buy, as I'm still new to CG) and low-poo (Shea Moisture Moisture Retention). I deep condition once a week (Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Mask). I do a pre-wash condition, (co-)wash, then S2C mostly upside down, but then rake my fingers through once right-side up to help my hair lay in the right direction. On wet hair, I crunch gel (DevaCurl Ultra Defining), and sometimes I'll use DevaCurl's Wave-Maker (""praying hands"" followed by scrunching) before I add the gel. I then plop for at least half an hour. This often means I let air-dry to completion, as I rarely wake up early enough to get through all of this before I have to be out the door, and I'm wearing my plop in the car during my commute. On the weekends, I diffuse after plopping, which helps with volume a bit, but not as much as I'd hope.

My hair has been long pretty much my whole life and has always dried mostly straight with slight bends in the mid-lengths and upturns on the ends, unless I had just gotten out of the pool or the ocean because then it would be wavier. 

Beginning Dec 2018 (top left) was when I decided to try enhancing the wave by trying the CGM, using healthier products, and cutting off 6 inches of bleach fried hair. 

End of Jan 2019 (middle left) was when I started trying to find other products and a routine that worked for me because the I could already tell that the straight CGM wasn't going to work for me. My hair never looked worse and it was always so weighed down. Started trying the NYM Curl Talk line, Shea Moisture's Detox collection, and some leftover DevaCurl Wavy products from my best friend.

In May 2019 (bottom left) I was really beginning to doubt whether or not I'd ever be able to get my hair to have a tighter wave pattern. The products were fine, just not working the way I wanted them too and I didn't have patience lol. But I kept going because I'm stubborn, I was just miserable while I was doing it.

My best friend was trying to give me advice, but she has a mix of 3a, b and c curls on her head and didn't really know much about my 2a (2b on a good day) hair. My mom told me to quit trying because, and I quote, ""Your hair has been straight your entire life, and it will always *be* straight."" Keep in mind that she has been telling me my whole life  that when I was a baby up until I was like 1 yr old my hair was really curly after she would wash me. Great, thanks for your support mom, love you too.

ANYWAY, the pic on the right is of the best hair day I've had so far, I love my hair, this hair day has reinvigorated my soul, and I'm going to keep doing my thing. I still had trouble getting all the crunch out of my hair but it really doesn't matter right now because my hair looks amazing to me. Any advice is greatly appreciated, hope you all are having a lovely day!

The problem is that I live in an apartment complex that has high mineral content in the water (hard water). I know this because my parents live in the country and when they didn't refill the water softener, my scalp got really cruddy after 1 day of not shampooing...and when they had full water softener, I could go many days without this cruddy feeling on my scalp. My hair is not naturally greasy. Without hard water, it's 4 days before I notice anything.

At my current apartment though, my hair feels cruddy all the time. If I try to shampoo say once a week, my hair is noticeably gross and feels disgusting. If I shampoo every other day, it's a little better but still not ideal. I tried laying off shampoo for 6 weeks, thinking maybe it was product buildup, but nothing happened. 

Not sure if it means anything, but I sweat heavily doing cardio 4-5x a week. 

Anyone in a similar situation who has product recommendations? Will I have to get one of those specialized formulas that cost a ton? I've tried apple cider vinegar rinse, but that didn't make a noticeable difference, either.

It's long enough to drag the curls down. It looks like you might have similar hair, but in any case, it might be helpful to take the rest of this comment with that context. 

1. The recommendations of this sub haven't worked for me as far as holding products go - gels and other styling products don't function that well and end up looking and feeling dirty on my long, fine hair strands. I've become much happier with my hair when I've cut the styling products and focused on conditioning and moisturizing. 

2. Another thing that just doesn't work well for me is air drying in the day or diffusing - both produce a terrible frizz that can pretty much be eliminated by washing at night and going to bed with damp hair. 

3. Technique matters, though it's so little stressed in comparison to products. I found massaging my scalp when shampooing (or when not shampooing, such as those times when I just condition the lengths of the hair) incredibly helpful in curbing dandruff. And I mean really massaging. This is more talked about, but something that enormously helps the moisture in my hair is conditioning by squeezing product up from the ends - but a lot of it, multiple times. I also use a product recommended for much curlier hair (the DC decadence line). I do rinse it mostly out. A lot of these conditioning techniques aren't out of the ordinary, but there are other ones - leaving it in, using a lighter one, using a lot (instead of a ton) - went working. I guess this is just to say that there are maybe more techniques you can try to see what works for your hair. 

3. I enjoy my hair more when I'm not desperately trying to coax the curls out - because it just doesn't work too well for me, partially because the weight always drags them down, and partially because I'm guilty of liking touchable hair, which doesn't work so well when it's loaded with products. While I'll use a microfiber towel or shirt to dry my hair, I often don't bother plopping so much as patting and gently squeezing along. I also brush out my hair, which absolutely does result in frizz, but then I'll loosely braid it, which smoothes it down no problem. These aren't normal recommendations on this sub, but I found when I stopped trying to ""embrace my curls"" and relaxed on all the products, my results were a lot more satisfying to the point that I don't spend time thinking about my hair anymore. 

Maybe some things to try out or take into consideration - and these are pretty easy, because you don't need to buy new stuff.",2c,hair fairly voluminous s fine texture pattern ranging s long drag curl look like similar hair case helpful rest comment context 1 recommendation sub haven t worked far holding product gel styling product t function end looking feeling dirty long fine hair strand happier hair styling product focused conditioning moisturizing 2 thing doesn t air drying day diffusing produce terrible frizz pretty eliminated washing night going bed damp hair 3 technique matter s little stressed comparison product massaging scalp shampooing shampooing time condition length hair incredibly helpful curbing dandruff mean massaging talked enormously help moisture hair conditioning squeezing product end multiple time use product recommended curlier hair dc decadence line rinse conditioning technique aren t ordinary one leaving lighter instead ton went working guess say technique work hair 3 enjoy hair m desperately trying coax curl doesn t partially weight drag partially m guilty liking touchable hair doesn t s loaded product ll use microfiber towel shirt dry hair t bother plopping patting gently squeezing brush hair absolutely doe result frizz ll loosely braid smoothes problem aren t normal recommendation sub stopped trying embrace curl relaxed product result satisfying point t spend time thinking hair anymore thing consideration pretty easy t buy new stuff,Devacurl,Morning/Nighttime Routines,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Curlygirl Method

My current routine involves cowashing with the standard Tresemme conditioner. After my shower, I squish water out of my hair with a shirt and use the praying hands method to apply LA sports gel; then I scrunch the gel in until my hands are on fire. Plop for an hour, let it airdry, then I throw it up in a pineapple without SOTC (although this doesn't seem to work, so I'll be changing that. I also just bought my first diffuser!!) Sometimes I'll use a few other products before gel, like Bella Curls Curl Defining Creme or Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie. I deep condition once every week or two with Shea Moisture Coconut Oil.

1. My hair naturally parts further over to the right, so I have a ton of hair over to the right and not a lot on the left. Consequently, my right is fairly well defined and voluminous, but my left side is lacking. My left side is more like waves. I also tend to sleep on my left side, which really doesn't seem to help. What can I do to help my left side live up to the right without having to change my part?
2. How does one know when to clarify? I'm having a hard time determining it.
3. On day 2-3, my curls are pretty much waves - which I'm fine with - but the frizz is horrible. Some parts even look totally straight! How can I help redefine my waves/curls? I have a spray bottle and numerous products at my disposal :)

Flipping my head over makes my curls very stringy. I use a cotton tee shirt to dry and plop then air dry. My hair is very frizzy and dry and is often sticky.¬†


Refresh isn't really great at this early stage. I have to saturate my hair every morning and I apply the curl custard. If its day two it three I either just wet the custard that is in my hair from day 1 or use just a tiny bit as a ""refresh""

This is my first post in this sub, so I will start with an introduction. I had straight hair all my life. My hair was fine and limp. Couldn't even hold a curl from perms or curling irons/rollers. Then I got pregnant, and started to get some very loose wave. After the kid was born, my hair went curly. Like a mix of 3a and 3b. I used no product, and used shampoo only. I would wash my hair once a week (when my hair was straight, I had to wash it daily or it was an oily mess), and these awesome spirals just formed. It was awesome. Then post partum shedding happened. I am closer to a 2b/2c now, which makes me sad. I loved the curls. 


I started the CGM basic plan here, (hair is still fine, and I think low porosity). It was great, but started to get really heavy for my hair. I got some small sized Devacurl products (low poo, one conditioner, super cream, light gel, and b'leave stuff). It has now worked so great on my hair. Like pretty bad. Day one I am at 2b/2c, then the next day, I am at 2a at best. It sucks. I have been reducing items from all that since, and now am just not using any devacurl, and back to the tresemme/blue gel routine, which is much better, but I know it is a matter of time before it is too heavy again. My kiddo has curls too, and we haven't cut his hair (he will be 3 soon), so I am just using the deva products on him, which is working out great for him. 


So I need a haircut. I haven't had a cut in like a year, aside from the one time I cut it myself. I looked for curly cutters in my area, because I want to do everything I can to preserve any curl I have left. I don't want to give it up. I have an appointment on the 19th, and am so excited (plus it is only $45, which is so awesome! I was scared of the $150 plus I was seeing online). She didn't give me any instructions, and I was wondering....what should I do? Should I just do a cowash, and leave it at that? I was thinking I would do a cowash the day before, and do no additional product. What should I expect from the whole devacut process?

I want to hold less of my curls in placeI have been sort of gradually easing into the cg method for a while now, and it has been going great. I actually have waves and curls instead of frizz! Then I thought I'd go one step further, and start using the recommended gel from the beginners routine (LA looks gel).


Normally my hair is quite curly when wet (anywhere between 3A and 3B, depending on where it is on my head) and then air dries into nice waves- somewhere between 2A and 2B- until it inevitably gets frizzy from the humidity. I really love how it looks in the waves, the curls just don't seem right on me. But the gel does exactly what it's advertised to do, holds all those curls in place so it looks super curly all the time.


My question is what products would protect against frizz while also maybe not holding so much of the original curl? Is mousse what I'm looking for, or just a less strong gel?

The smell makes me sick for some reason.  Am open to other, but have to be budget friendly. No bumble and bumble or devacurl.

For reference: To refresh I spray down my hair in sections with a waterbottle with a little conditioner mixed in. Add a little more Biotera gel, smooth it over the sections, praying hands method, and then scrunch. To help get rid of some frizz, I'll run my hands under hot water, add a tiny bit of oil (GVP brand, doesn't specify any type of oil on the label, and it's not CG approved, but it's what I have for the time being. I am looking to switch to sweet almond oil or coconut oil) and then run my hands together and lightly, barely touching the strands smooth my hands over my hair. Give my hair a shake and maybe scrunch a couple more sections. Usually let air dry because I don't have time to diffuse most mornings (or can't because hubby is still sleeping.)

I'm only 2-3 weeks into the CG method, seeing some promising results but know I have a long ways to go yet.  I think I have 2c hair, but i think I'm seeing some 3a emerging. My hair is also high porosity, especially my ends.

It's either too much it weighs my hair down or too little that it doesn't actually do anything. I really wanted to like these brands but I've given up.

Kinky Curly is probably the brand I've had the most success with. I love the low-poo and leave-in conditioner. I tried the custard early on but didn't know enough about application techniques to know what I was doing. I want to pick some up and try again.

21469,/r/curlyhair/comments/dmg54t/start_here_beginner_info_weekly_no_question_is/f581j1u/,"&gt;Hey all, so looking for a couple of answers. Thanks in advance for all the help!
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, I'm a classic hated-my-hair in my teens, learning-to-love-my-hair in my mid-20s. 3b(ish) with possibly high porosity (but i took some online quizzes, don't quote me), and tends to be between chin to shoulder length.  Currently i wash with water, and use kevinmurphy motion lotion (used to use killer curls too) most mornings after my 'wash'.
&gt;
&gt;Can we confirm that my planned routine is about right?
&gt;
&gt;1. I'll be doing a reset wash with something like VO5
&gt;2. In the shower I'll want to 'cleanse' with either a conditioner (co-wash?) or something like devacurl no-poo. And I do this daily/weekly/monthly, however often it takes to keep it feeling clean
&gt;3. In the mornings to replace my water/motionlotion routine, i'll condition with something (suggestions please!), and then rinse some/most out depending on what I find makes me feel the least gross leaving conditioner in
&gt;4. I'll then style...what do you all recommend I use? 
&gt;
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
&gt;
&gt;QUESTION: product suggestions? And how do you use it? How much conditioner should I leave in? And what conditioner do you all use? I want to avoid frizz, so I feel like this has to happen every morning, right?
&gt;
&gt;I also want to try plopping, so I've read you can either plop in the morning, and then diffuse, but I don't have a diffuser, so QUESTION: should I flip over into a shirt for a while, and then let it air dry? Or can I do this in the evenings with product, sleep with the shirt on, and wake up in the morning to hopefully lovely curls?

I agreed to it. It burned but I thought it was normal cause I heard that relaxer burns. My hair is unusually thick and the hairdresser wanted to go to her break so she didnt wash the relaxer out properly. I didnt know this but on the way home I had a horrible headache and felt sick and I almost passed out. I realised that this must be to do with the relaxer so I rinsed my hair under the shower. I didnt realise I needed to wash the relaxer out with shampoo. I still felt sick the next day and the day after that. Now I realise that the relaxer must have gone into my blood via my skin. My head burned horribly and my hair felt like it was covered in a layer of plastic (the relaxer). It took me four days to work out that the relaxer was still on my head (I was moving flats at the time so I was distracted). When I washed my hair with shampoo I felt instant relief. But things just got worse. My hair started falling out in clumps and it burned  and itched I went to 6 doctors and 4 told me my scalp was just a little red and gave me soft shampoo and mild antibacterial ointment (which I could not apply because of my thick curly hair : it got nowhere near my scalp). One told me there was nothing wrong me. None of them knew what relaxer is (I live in a very white part of europe) and visibly did not believe me when I told them it contained very dangerous chemicals. Its almost been a year now and the sixth doctor told me that a toxic shock made my hair fall out (the relaxer) and that the fact that it was still burning and itching was due to an infection Id contracted when the defences of the skin on my skalp were disabled (the seborrheic eczema). Seborrhic eczema is chronic and no treatment has worked due to the texture of my hair (nothing reached my scalp). I have now shaved my head (I wouldnt have dared to if I wasnt in quarentine) and im applying every medication (tablets, creme, shampoo, cortisol).

Currently I am using the cheap introductory products from the sidebar. After 3 months of the CG method, my curls look better but frizz/general mess is still an issue after 6 hours... Which is disappointing since it takes 2-3 hours for my hair to dry  to the point I can scrunch out the gel. 

My curls look their best after I use a clarifying shampoo (only used every month or so) followed by a lot of conditioner, add more conditioner after getting out of the shower, then comb out the knots/part it, scrunch up, let my hair air dry for 15 minutes, softly scrunch with a cotton shirt to pull excess water, and then apply gel, let dry, and end with scrunching out the crunch about 2 hours later. 

This last week I almost got it to a point where day two *could* be okay if I wasn't working that day and didn't have to pull off a professional look. Still, that's progress from looking like a mess before the end of the day!

I'm like a 2c/3a but my hair is fine, so it's easily rough dried on low to a softer, smoother wave.

My advice is that whenever it's too much for you, ditch the styling, so the long diffusing sesh and the crunch, but put what effort you can into avoiding silicones, sulfates except for clarifying, and alcohols. I guarantee your hair will keep getting healthier and healthier, and you can always pick it all back up once you feel inspired again :)",2c,finally success wavemaker mean wish amazing awful result felt qualm returning getting 30 buck haha s okay discouraged honestly right m loving extra curl hair eventually long routine treatment ll break especially real admit hair possibly like isn t curly t option m like hair fine s easily rough dried softer smoother wave advice s ditch styling long diffusing sesh crunch effort avoiding silicone sulfate clarifying alcohol guarantee hair getting healthier healthier pick feel inspired,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Moisturizing and Deep Treatments,Heat Damage & Growing Advice,Devacurl

I've been CG'ing for about half a year or so, but a bit half-baked. I wasn't using a gel, wasn't clarifying since my first reset wash, not deep conditioning, etc. So I bought some new products today, made sure they were CG, and excited to try them out tomorrow.

My problem is: my hair is a mix of anywhere from 2C curls to 3B, botticelli mixed with ringlets. Love it, but after one night of sleeping the ringlets get tangled and most of my other hair is a frizzy, flat curl mess. It's too short to pineapple, and I've tried sleeping on a satin pillowcase but for some reason it made it worse (???).

Does anyone have the same problem? My hair gets pretty coarse towards day 4, which is usually when I wash it again. But I simply can't wet it everyday, it would be way too time consuming. Air drying takes at least 4 hours, and I would run out of all my products way too quickly (I do have a diffuser, but I don't want to use heat on my hair more often than once a week because it can get pretty dry and coarse).

Here is a folder with pictures up close of different strands of my hair that are all different textures. Do I need more protein??? I have included photos of my hair in the folder. The blurry one is a picture of me from two years ago, the one where I am in front of a lake is from June, and the one where I am on a couch is from a week or two ago.  

A lot of my hair is relatively straight with one or two bends but the new growth of hair that I have is curly. I'm a sophomore in high school and have always considered myself around 2b and sometimes 2a. It might be hormones doing weird stuff to my hair. My hair was straight when I was little and went 2a sometime during puberty. Is my hair transitioning? My hairs don't clump right because of the different patterns at the top so its very frizzy. My hair always feels kind of limp and soft too, so I've been using protein like the Neutral Protein Filler in a spray bottle mixed with water and recently tried a gelatin mask. The overall texture of my hair hasn't been changed very much. Since a majority of my hair is 2a, the curly pieces and 2c pieces blend together in clumps to create a 2b like overall texture. My hair reacts very well to protein and seems to love it which is odd because my hair takes 2+ hours to dry, so I've always assumed its low porosity. I haven't over done it with the protein yet.   I am pretty sure my hair is damaged via sun even though it is virgin and I last used heat on it to curl it and that was around four months ago. I don't straighten my hair ever and haven't done it in four years. The sun damage comes from being outside over 100+ hours during the summer from band camp, and I'm in band for 10+ hours a week outside not including games and competitions. My dad is white with 2a hair and my mother asian with straight hair. 

FYI: I tried posting this a few minutes ago and realized how much of a trainwreck it was since you could only see the picture of the almost straight strand since reddit doesn't allow multiple photos... 

My routine is using Renpure's Coconut Cream conditioner and Renpure Advanced Coconut Water Shampoo Coconut Cream. I am aware it has Amodimethicone but it doesn't have the tendency to build up on my hair or build up over itself on hair strands. I'm most likely switching conditioners soon to a fragrance free one. The coco betaine in the shampoo also will easily get the amodimethicone out. :) My stylers are Jessicurl's fragrance free Rockin Ringlets and Spiralicious Gel.

\- Note how in photos 2-4, my hair is tight at the ends, but elongated further up?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Background**

I've been growing my hair out for 3 years (!!) as a curly guy.

Back when I had short(er) hair -- about 2-4 inches long, years ago -- I used to straighten it and style it straight up into a spikey hairstyle of sorts. I would never wear it curly, and did this for 4-5 years.

3 years ago, I took the plunge and grew out my hair to embrace the curls (it's really hard to style 3b/3c curls in a short hair style).

I suspect my curl pattern is **3b**/3c, and my hair porosity is **low/medium** (didn't sink at all in the float test, but I swear it probably is more high porosity than low...)

It's naturally extremely frizzy and dry. If I don't add leave-in, **and** a styling cream of some sorts, my hair loses all curl pattern, turns into a frizzy afro mess, and actually hurts my scalp (not sure why, but I suspect the lack of moisture causes dryness, irritating my scalp and hair shafts). For this reason, I *always* style my hair after a shower.

&amp;#x200B;

I co-wash and re-style my hair about 4 times a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday).  
Usually end up putting my hair in a tight pony tail on day one, and carrying it over to the morning of day two. If I don't do this, my hair gets unruly and all over the place.  
Doesn't help that I work at an office and should ideally have my hair up as a dude.  
Also, I hit the gym 5x a week, necessitating a full shower.

I try to pineapple when I go to bed, but regardless of how I wear my hair during the night time, when I wake up, I can't bun it without a thousand thin strands of flyaways and frizz poking out (need to shower and style as a result).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a huge problem with knots, hair shedding (or maybe just male pattern baldness.. Who knows? I'm 23 and still have a full head of hair, but lose a huge handful of hair in the shower -- think a 1/6th of a cup of hair when packed tightly), and breakage.  
\- Addressing knot problem via detangling in the shower and using more conditioner. Been working alright so far. I think the knots are happening because of the products I'm using, coupled with the lack of a hair cut for 3+ years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Styling Process (wash-n-go):**

1. Cowash hair using *Mane n' Tail Conditioner*
2. Plop hair in Microfiber towel (I use a pillowcase haha!)
3. Get dressed, trim/shave beard, etc.
4. After hair has somewhat dried, use *Mixed Chicks Leave-in*
5. Work in *Kinkly Curly Curling Custard* to Style

&amp;#x200B;

The end result isn't super desirable IMO, but it's been the best compared to other product mixes I've tried.

\- For some reason, after my hair fully dries, the ends become super coiled and tight, while the hair around my roots are pleasantly elongated ([see photo link](https://imgur.com/a/bV8MY8v))

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals:**

*What I'm hoping to achieve is a more elongated curl style all-around, and would appreciate any tips you could provide!*

I often have trouble with frizz and flyaways, and would like to minimize these with the styling products I use. Any tips? Previously tried L.O.C (leave in, then oil, then cream), and L.C.O (Leave-in, Cream, then Oil).   
I now leave out the oil entirely as I found it frizzes my hair, and doesn't provide much benefits (tried Argon Oil, Olive Oil, and Macadamia Oil).

I'd also like to get my hair to fall by the side of my face instead of growing out with extreme volume. Will help me wear my hair down a little more professionally at work if I could tuck it behind my ears.

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that I'm due for a cut. I'm looking around my city (Toronto, Canada) for hair stylists that can work with my hair and share some styling advice. I'm probably going to cut it to be around shoulder length when curly &amp; dry.

\- I hear a lot about DevaCurl and Ouidad. What are your thoughts on this? Personally, the cost of the hair care products are out of reach :(.

Would also love to hear your thoughts on a wash-n-go process that might benefit me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Products I've used**

I've been trying to style my hair in a way where it's looser and the curls aren't super tight. I haven't been having much success, and tried a myriad of **styling products**:

\- Kinky Curly - Curling Custard (current, don't mind, working okay)  
\- Aunt Jackie's - Don't Shrink Gel (didn't like, it's too gel-y &amp; drying)  
\- Au Natrule - Anti-Shrinking Clumping Gel (didn't like, it was too drying)  
\- As I Am Naturally - Twist Defining Cream (didn't mind, worked somewhat okay)  
\- Shea Moisture - Curl Enhancing Smoothie (didn't mind, worked somewhat okay)

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried several **Conditioners** (I co-wash; haven't used shampoo in 2+ years):

\- Mane n Tail - Original Conditioner (current, working pretty well when I use a LOT)  
\- As I Am Naturally -  Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner (not sure if I liked this. Got pretty drying and left me more frizzy)  
\- Carol's Daughter - Hair Milk Cleansing Conditioner (worked okay, I think was pricey(?))  
\- Curls - Blueberry Bliss conditioner (Had a small size bottle, and don't think I landed on whether I liked it or not)  
\- Some other stuff by L'oreal (meh)

&amp;#x200B;

My **Leave-in Conditioner** of choice has, for 2 years, been:

\- Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner

25724,/r/curlyhair/comments/b8n6xw/im_shaving_my_head/,"I'm shaving my headOkay so a little background first, I'm a 24M who's had varying lengths of hair throughout my life, but I generally keep it pretty short (average length of about 3-4 inches, with a little longer on top). Part of the reason I don't let my hair get too long, however, is because it starts to get difficult to control after a certain point and I've never even really thought about changing up my routine to address that. A couple weeks ago, however, I decided that I was going to take part in a cancer research fundraiser where people shave their heads and get people to donate money and all that jazz. Thinking about getting rid of all of my hair really got my thinking about just how little I respect and appreciate it, and led me to coming to this subreddit after seeing it pop up on the front page from time to time and see what it's all about. I had the idea that if I'm gonna be growing my hair back from zero, I should try and grow it ""right"". I might be thinking about this wrong, but I wanted to reach out and see if there are any tips that you all might have about things that I can be doing from the start to truly embrace my CG potential when my hair finally gets long enough for it to really matter.

Currently, my routine consists of washing my hair pretty much everyday with Aussie Volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I'm already well aware that this is so far from what I should be doing for my hair, but that's why I need any help I can get! I figure if nothing else, this could be a good time for me to cut back the frequency that I wash my hair since it can't look greasy if it's not there lol.

I will say, I've done a good bit of reading through the wiki and even picked up the products I would need for the cheap and easy intro to the CG method. I've got Mane &amp; Tail Shampoo for the reset wash, Tresemme Botanique Nourish &amp; Replenish with Coconut Milk &amp; Aloe Vera for co-washing and conditioning, and Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Gel for... gelling. I'm planning on following the directions on the beginner's guide for a few weeks to see how it affects my hair and be able to provide some more info at that point, but I found myself a little unsure as to how strictly I should follow some of the steps just given what I already know (especially relating to how much conditioner, etc. to use). For starters, while I get some tighter curls near my temples and had plenty of loose curls when I was a toddler, I seem to mostly have type 2a or 2b wavy hair. Additionally, my hair is definitely on the finer side, and as I said earlier, pretty short compared to a lot of what I see on here.

* Diffuse upside down with Conair Infiniti Pro and Xtava Black Orchid diffuser up 80% dry
* Root clip and leave hair to finish air drying

A little bit of my story in case anyone's interested:

Growing up I had the curliest, thickest, most tangled hair (I know you guys feel my pain). My older sister has the same hair as me, only blonde, so when I hit middle school I just did my hair like she did (wash/condition with whatever and whatever mousse we had). When I got to high school I hated my hair and started dying it and straightening everyday until senior year. Then I basically went back to my middle school routine, but not before seriously damaging my hair and having in thin out to half of what it used to be. 

I have also been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed as a kid and depression since middle school. After my freshman year of college I hit a new low and started therapy again but with a different therapist and started medication for the first time. Things got better but I still struggled with basic things, including hygiene. I would spend days in bed and not shower for a week (gross, I know). I stopped wearing make up and  always wore my hair in a ponytail or bun. 

After showering one day I got so fed up with my hair I looked up subreddits for healthier hair and ended up finding this page. I picked up some VO5 shampoo, gel, and a new conditioner and my obsession began. I have spent HOURS on this page and Youtube. I never imagined it would be this easy to get my hair so perfect. 

An unexpected side effect of starting CGM was how much my anxiety/depression has improved. It's a huge confidence boost and I get complimented any time I go out in public. Even my all male coworkers talk about and complimented my hair when I try something new. I've started paying attention to my appearance again (I always loved dressing up and looking nice for no reason) and I can easily get myself to shower every other day instead of once or twice a week. I spend more time keeping my shower and hair area clean. I wake up early to refresh my hair instead of 10 min before I need to leave the house instead of sleeping all day. 

Confidence and better hair I expected, but everything else has been an added bonus. It's a great way to focus on self-care. Sorry for the long post, it's just been an amazing journey for me so far. And thank you to everyone on this page! I would be lost without all of your posts and comments!

36415,/r/curlyhair/comments/cnlq9c/how_do_you_guys_detangle_on_days_you_dont_wash/,"How do you guys detangle on days you don't wash?Hi, fellow curlies! 

I'm so sorry if this is a stupid question, but I have been lurking on this sub for a while trying to tame my curls and there is a problem I haven't been able to find literally any solution to. Was hoping somebody here could help out!

My hair type: big curls (probably 3a or 3b), bra strap length, really thin individual hairs but there is A LOT of it (pretty much every hair dresser I go to comments on how freaking much hair I have). According to the last hair dresser I went to my hair is very healthy, and I just got my split ends cut off. It is also very heavy.

My routine: wash every other day with medicated shampoo (this is sadly an unchangeable thing), use Love Beauty Planet conditioner and detangle in shower, then leave most of the conditioner in. Put in coconut oil, plop 5 min, air dry.

MY ISSUE: I have absolutely no idea how you guys go without brushing your hair every day. Mine literally gets MATTED just from existing. I put it up to sleep, use a silk wrap and everything, but then I wake up and go about my day and chunks of my hair will literally become some kind of fucked up dreadlock if I dont brush it by the morning of day 2. I try to finger comb, but if I did it correctly I think it would legit take hours.

14559,/r/curlyhair/comments/96wo05/combination_hair_straight_on_top_wavy_underneath/e43rtqy/,"It‚Äôs probably damage if you just started taking care of your curls. I have similar hair with some of the same problems. 2c mostly with some 3A, shoulder length when curl, fine, very high density with a damaged top layer that stays overly dry, leaving it frizzy/less defined. 

I actually got something to finally work yesterday.


Routine I Usually Do:

Devacurl No-poo &amp; their One Conditioner (the orig. ones), followed by their Styling Cream, and then either their light or ultra defining gel (I prefer the light over ultra. Better hold for me and doesn‚Äôt make my curls/waves weighed down). I also do protein treatments followed by moisturizing deep conditioning treatments once a week or so. The protein treatments have really helped some of my curls on the top layer spring back up. 


Routine I Did Yesterday:

I got a little carried away with putting oils on (jojoba &amp; Vit E), so my hair got super oily. Just drenched. So decided to use the DevaCurl Buildup Buster in place of the No-poo to help wash out some of the excess oil. I followed with the One Conditioner using the Squish 2 Condish method to apply it. Next, I used just a couple of drops of Argan Oil rubbed together in my palms to seal the moisture in my hair. I just carefully smoothed over my canopy with the oil and underneath and then got a tiny bit more on my hands &amp; scrunched it in. I also used some to smooth over the ends at the very bottom and over the top layer where I have split ends and breakage. 

Next, scrunched the excess water out with a microfiber towel. Got out of shower and finger combed through my hair, making sure to spread it out for better distribution of styling products. Applied DevaCurl Styling Cream using the praying hands Method. Then scrunched upward. Kept scrunching until tight waves &amp; ringlets started to reform. Used same towel again to scrunch out any excess product. Plopped with long sleeve t-shirt for about 10 minutes or so. Scrunched with towel again. Then used dryer on low speed/cool &amp; diffused hair to almost dry. 

I think finally doing the Squish to Condish method correctly for the first time and adding in the Argan oil to seal made the most difference. My hair was so soft and defined. Even the top layer with minimal frizz. So definitely look up YouTube videos on how to do the Squish 2 Condish correctly because I think that‚Äôs key to really getting the moisture into your hair. 

Sorry for the novel above. (I tend to be long-winded üòâ) But since it sounds like we have such similar hair with the same problems, I wanted to share with you exactly what I did to get vastly better results.

First of all, my hair is baby fine, (supposedly) straight, mid-high porosity, and medium density.

All my life, I‚Äôve LONGED for curly/wavy hair. My hair has always been flat and dull and boooring. In high school, I bleached my hair, but it never really caused me problems. My hair has always felt soft, I‚Äôve never really suffered much breakage. Eventually, I decided to revert to my natural color (maybe a little more red than my ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, but definitely less upkeep).

Anyway, I noticed when the weather was humid (or when washing dishes at work), my baby hairs around my temple would start to wave a little. Baby ringlets. LOVED them. My hair has also always had a slight bend in it and some kicks around my part.  So when I started to notice my ends were ALWAYS tangled and brittle-feeling, I started to think that maybe my hair was wavy, but since it‚Äôs fine, and I‚Äôve been treating it like it was straight my whole life (and killing it with bleach and sulfates and silicones), my wave pattern has been stretched out. 

The first time I did the CG method (a few weeks ago), I was thrilled! It actually had some definition and wave.

My mom (I‚Äôm 20, but going to cosmetology school atm, so am still living with my parents) has been against it from the beginning, and continuously tells me I‚Äôm forcing a wave pattern. I‚Äôve been so excited about the changes I‚Äôm already seeing in my hair, but can‚Äôt go show her without her giving a judgemental look. She has wavy hair as well, but her wave pattern is more defined than mine. She told me today that she told her hairstylist about me ‚Äútrying to get curls‚Äù and that it wasn‚Äôt something that, in the long run, will hold up. BUT, she doesn‚Äôt really understand the method or the purpose behind it, because she won‚Äôt listen. Oh, well. It doesn‚Äôt bother me all that much, but it is still frustrating to finally be enjoying my hair and be told I‚Äôm forcing it and I should stop.

I‚Äôm definitely not going to stop, though. Even though I‚Äôm only a few weeks into the method, my hair has never felt better. I‚Äôm still getting used to it, but wow, I‚Äôm absolutely loving caring for my hair. Even though my hair isn‚Äôt going to get beyond probably a 2b/2c at most, I‚Äôm so happy with my waves and HEALTHY hair. This subreddit is changing my life!

Routine:

‚Ä¢ Shampoo once every few days (when needed) with Pacifica Pineapple Curls Shampoo; Conditioning every wash (every 3ish days) with Pacifica Pineapple Curls Conditioner (rinsing it all out). Squish to condish

22655,/r/curlyhair/comments/9eyrs2/considering_a_keratin_complex_treatmentthoughts/e5sspy1/,"I‚Äôve done a few keratin treatments as have people I‚Äôve known. I haven‚Äôt really had a big issue bouncing back afterwards. I have 3A/3b hair, though it was more 3b/3c when I was younger. My hair is kinda damaged, high porosity, and thinner now than it was but I also straightened it daily for about seven years and only stopped a year ago. 

So when I say my hair bounced back, what I mean is that my curl pattern has remained, none of my hair broke off, I didn‚Äôt have to do a big chop, and I don‚Äôt have flat bits that won‚Äôt curl right at the ends. 

A relative did a keratin treatment and now her ends don‚Äôt really curl. Her hair is 3A and the ends are pretty flat even though the roots and body are very curly. A friend did a keratin treatment and had to cut most of her length off. Her hair is okay now but she had hair to her hips and now she has hair at her shoulders. 

There is also a keratin express treatment which only lasts 6 weeks (4 IMO). It‚Äôs much cheaper and doesn‚Äôt really straighten or relax so much as cut frizz a lot and gentle out the curl pattern. My curls are a bit less ringlet and a bit more wavy, but the difference was slight. It was more about making it more manageable. 

As far as identity, I can‚Äôt relate from a racial standpoint, but I can a bit from an ethnic one. I‚Äôm Jewish, and with my hair straightened it‚Äôs not really possible to tell. With my hair curly it feels very obvious to me. It makes me look Jewish which can at times affect how I‚Äôm treated or spoken to. I also feel much less attractive with curly hair. I‚Äôm newly single but I know exes have strongly preferred my hair straight and so do I. I feel like I have to compensate for my hair by making sure I‚Äôm dressed in a more polished way and have makeup on at work.

In fact, in the ‚Äúbefore"" picture, I had blow-dried my hair straight that morning. As seems to be a common thread here, I thought my hair was just straight yet stubborn. I was washing it every day and using conditioners and serums containing silicone. And then I found this sub.

ROUTINE: 

Wash with lukewarm water every 3 to 5 days, alternating between **Devacurl Low Poo Original** and **As I Am Coconut Cowash**.  

About once a week I use a packet of **Cantu Rhassoul Clay Masque** (Not technically CG approved because of beeswax but seems to be doing wonders for my hair. To be safe, I plan to switch it out for another deep conditioner in future.) Detangle once mask is in with a wide-toothed comb, squish to condish, pile hair on top of head &amp; leave it for about 30 minutes. I then gather the hair at the nape of my neck and rinse out 80% to 100% of the mask with cool water.

On mask days I skip a leave-in and go straight to gel. On regular days I‚Äôll put in a blueberry sized amount of **Kinky Curl‚Äôs Knot Today** with prayer hands, but I find it sticky so won‚Äôt be repurchasing.

I scrunch in **Eco Styling Gel Olive Oil** (cheap) or **Curls Blueberry Bliss Curl Control Jelly** (expensive but heavenly smelling). Diffuse on cool or air dry. Scrunch out the crunch.

I sleep in a satin bonnet AND on a satin pillowcase because I toss and turn a lot. On the night before a low poo wash I‚Äôll saturate my hair with a mix of jojoba and castor oil, massaging the scalp and working it though to the ends, and then pop on a form fitting shower cap under my satin bonnet and leave the oils on while sleeping.

10098,/r/curlyhair/comments/aohnra/cg_for_a_month_and_just_look_at_the_difference/eg0vur2/,"Routine at first: Started with beginner routine of cowashing with TRESemme Botanical Nourish and Replenish, S2C with head upside down more TRESemme, rinse 90% of it out with head upside down still, then scrunch in HANDFULS of LA Looks Extreme Sport Gel, scrunch extra water out with cotton tshirt then plop for an 30 mins to an hour, then air dry (takes like 8 hours for me). I saw a huge difference with this, but I was still getting lots of frizzies and I just couldn't handle the drying time. After figuring out I have high porosity hair (which is weird because it takes forever to dry), and that I have 2b-2c thick and dense hair, I made the painful first purchase of DeveCurl products, a satin bonnet, a turbie twist, a wet comb, and a satin pillowcase. 

Routine now: In cool to lukewarm water, wet whole head and use wide toothed comb to gently detangle hair from the ends up. Then, take 3-4 pumps of DevaCurl No Poo Shampoo, emulsify, and scrub my scalp with it like you would cowash. Rinse out. Then take 10-12 pumps of DevaCurl OneCondition Original Conditioner and apply to all of my hair except the roots. At this point, I flip my head upside down, use my wet comb to smooth all of my hair into clumps, and rinse 90% of the conditioner out upside down without running my fingers through it. Leaving my head upside down with sopping wet hair, I take 2-3 pumps of DevaCurl B Leave In and praying hands method that into my hair and lightly scrunch. Then I take 5-6 pumps of DevaCurl Ultra Hold Gel and praying hands that evenly over my hair and lightly scrunch. Finally, I take Shea Moisture Manuka Honey Gel on my finger tips and smooth in any flyaways I see into the curl clumps. Then,  take my trusty cotton T shirt and plop (no scrunching out extra moisture first, as that seems to give me tons of flyaways). Leave plopped for about an hour or two, then take off and air dry for at least an hour. After an hour, the gel cast seems to be pretty set and I'm safe to diffuse on cool (no heat) and low speed. Then, scrunch out the crunch and I've got beautiful shiny bouncy frizz free (mostly) curls/waves!

13137,/r/curlyhair/comments/fa7msg/first_day_starting_the_cgm_this_is_my_hair_after/fiwfp1h/,"I've had wavy hair all my life. I usually let it loose when I was little, then I started pulling it into a high ponytail. I always brushed it (or my mother did) when it was wet, but also when it was fully dry, which created tons of frizz. that's why I started putting it ONLY into a tight high pony when I was in 6-7th grade. it was a nightmare.

I've been wearing it loose since maybe 8-9th grade, now in my last year of high school I started using scrunchies to pull it up into a half-up bun or a full messy bun.

I kept dying it for a few years with shampoos and permanent dyes, but never bleached.
this year I told myself I'm not going to dye it and I'll let it grow out.

I don't exactly have a routine yet, but I washed my hair yesterday with cgm approved products so I suppose I'll tell you how it went:

first I put a dime sized glob of Nature Box shampoo with olive oil (smells so amazing) into the front and sides of my hair - washing over the tub, upside down. I then put it on the back of my hair/head and scrubbed it on my scalp gently with the tips of my fingers. I only wash my scalp and roots with shampoo, then let it run to the ends as I wash it off.

I then took the Nature Box conditioner with olive oil, took maybe the same amount and applied it to my hair (I think y'all call it ""prayer hands""? also put it on the hair that was actually hanging off my head, not the roots)  then ran a wide tooth comb through it til it was smooth and without knots. I washed that out thoroughly. my hair was nice and silky and soft at that point. I squeezed as much water out as I could, very gently.

now, I've forgotten the mousse I used. once I'm done with school I'll post it as a reply to this comment. but I used maybe smaller than a golf ball sized amount of strong hold hair mousse, ran it through my hair both with prayer hands and raking it in, then scrunched. I then took a little bit more and only scrunched with it.

left that in, plopped in a t-shirt and went to sleep. when I woke up it was still damp, so I let it out of the shirt, shook it out a little bit and let it air dry.

Hi guys! This subreddit is such a big source of inspiration and it's the first time I've felt hopeful that I might just once learn to like my hair. Honestly, ever since I can remember I've hated my natural hair, the only time I would happily wear my hair down is when I'd straightened it. I've mostly stopped doing that (reduced it to max. once per 2 months) and now I just really want to embrace my hair and be able to wear it down. I'm sick of always wearing buns or ponytails and altogether just feeling terrible when spending hours trying to make it look decent only to give up and put it up in a bun. 

I've started CG method about 2 weeks ago and have tried different routines every time, since none of them gave me a good result. Also, I *think* I have high porosity, thin, fine 2B/2C hair.

My routine before this photo was taken:  
Note: *I did everything upright, because the last times I did it with my hair flipped over I just ended up with weird bumps in my hair, that's probably why you see the weird semi-flat part at the top.*   
1. Comb out any small knots with a little conditioner in wet hair using wide tooth comb.    
2. Washed my hair with Nature Box Shampoo (cg approved)   
3. Squish to condish with Petal Fresh Strengthening Conditioner Seaweed &amp; Argan Oil  
4. Squish hair with microfiber towel to take out most moisture  
5. Apply leave-in (Curls, blueberry bliss)   
6. Dry a little more with microfiber towel by squishing hair   
7. Add Lotta Body Milk Honey Curl Defining Mouse, covering my hair with it using flat hands   
8. Left to airdry   


Today I tried to not focus too much on creating many curls, but I wanted to see if I could at least get it to be less frizzy even if not so curly. As you can tell, that did not work. I also seem to have a top layer of hair that just refuses to go curly/wavy, I feel like that's a large contributing factor to my overall messy hair look.   


I also tried diffusing, which did help in creating more curls, but not in less frizz.

I have a few questions/concerns and was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction!  I am specifically looking for product recs that might fit my needs. 




My hair: I have extremely thick, course hair that mainly hovers around a 2b on the scale, with a layer of 2a over the top and some awesome 2c hidden away underneath.    




My issues: My hair never dries. From my reading here, this means I have low porosity. Yes? If I air dry, my hair feels wet and waxy. It will literally feel like this for days until I wash it and immediately dry with a diffuser. I have tried other low-poo and no-poo methods in the past (and given them months of trying) and my hair gets dull, limp and heavy with that waxy feel. For other context, I live in an extremely humid climate with extremely hard water.      



Other notes: I'm about to have a baby, so I know that post-partum hairloss will be upon me in a few months. Should I wait to start CG until after the exodus? I'm also really into cruelty-free and fragrance-free whenever possible.

24yo, curly from birth.

Started blow drying my hair WEEKLY at 6 years old, no exaggeration.

First chemical straightening treatment at 14. Did that 2x a year until I was 17 and moved away from home with no access to my hairdresser. 

17-23yo: continued to blow dry once a week. Flat ironed daily. 

November 2017: decided I wanted to be natural and chopped all my hair off.  Top left pic is right before the cut. Bottom left is on December 25th, so about month after the chop. 

Present: photo on the right. I‚Äôm a 3b/3c and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of how far I‚Äôve come. Especially since I haven‚Äôt seen my curls in years. My mom says my curl pattern is different from when I was a baby (naturally). She said it used to be wavy-ish. So I assume I was a 2c/3a back then. 

CURRENT ROUTINE: I just took box braids out a week ago.

WASH:
My first wash after the braids was with....
‚Ä¢ Shea Moisture Sacha Inchi Oil Omega 3, 6, 9 Recuse + Repair Clarifying Shampoo
‚Ä¢ Shea Moisture Coconut + Hibiscus Curl &amp; Shine Conditioner 
‚Ä¢  Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Treatment Mask

STYLE:
I get my hair soaking wet in the shower every morning. Once I get out and while it‚Äôs still dripping wet, I do the LCO method. 
‚Ä¢ Liquid: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey &amp; Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-In
‚Ä¢ Cream: Camille Rose Naturals Curl Love Moisture Milk
Oil: Hollywood Beauty Jojoba Oil

Before bed, I will massage my scalp with:
‚Ä¢ Curls Blueberry Bliss Hair Growth Oil
‚Ä¢ BB Oil Moisturizer 

I then wrap my hair in a silk scarf and also sleep on a silk pillow case, just in case the scarf comes off (it will sometimes because I‚Äôm a wilder sleeper haha). 

I‚Äôve been taking biotin and fish oil daily (well, almost) as well. I noticed a big difference when I took Bounce Curl supplements but the bottle is like $25 for a 30 day supply and I don‚Äôt have the money for that, honestly. I ordered a bottle of Sports Research Biotin off Amazon. I don‚Äôt remember how much it was but I got a 4 month supply of it (1 bottle = 120 pills and you take 1 per day).

Fast forward to me realizing a little bit of sweat brought the curls to life and especially added volume and sheen to my otherwise 2C frizz. I stopped shampooing cold turkey based on an instinct. Didn‚Äôt know it was a revolutionary idea until a few years later. 

Routine now: 
Finger brush the tangles out - I usually do this two to three times a week or whenever is a ‚Äúwashday‚Äù. I threw away all my brushes and combs a year ago when I learned about the CG method. This is how I avoid the dust bunny hair gum that comes out in combs. 

Once every other week &lt;Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Curl and Shine Conditioner&gt; massaged into mids and ends at the beginning of a shower.

The photo I posted is day 3 of up in a bun hair, and was more so to show the lower end capacity of my curls as well as how thin it is.

18343,/r/curlyhair/comments/esn8y4/hi_yall_looking_for_advice_about_overall_curl/ffckm0e/,"I can tell you that it often takes time for your natural curl pattern to show itself after starting CGM.  The best way to encourage your natural pattern all over your head is to really dive into the method and stick with it.  I started CGM in August after many years of abusing my hair.  My curl pattern was really wacky with 2a waves at the crown and a mix of curl types up to 3a at the nape of my neck.

Now that I've been on the CGM for several months, my curls have improved a lot.  They're still a little wacky, though.  The hair that was 2a wavy at my crown now has curly roots.  I'll be cutting off some of those straighter ends this weekend, so I have high hopes for my hair over the next several months.

I've been pretty happy with my wacky hair since starting CG, though.  It seems to improve with every wash.  There are things that I do to encourage my natural curl.  My personal favorite is styling with a Denman brush.  Sometimes I'll make pin curls with the most stubborn sections at my crown.  Finger coiling doesn't work well for me, but I've seen other people have awesome results with that method.  It's kind of like training your curls to be the best that they can be.

Looking at your routine, there's only a few things that stand out.  It's not really good to comb dry curly hair.  I like to follow the method and detangle it in the shower with a wide tooth comb or a wet brush while I have my hair coated with a slippery conditioner only.  I've found that I'm getting a lot less breakage.

The way you're plopping could be affecting your curl pattern.  There are two main purposes of the plop.  The first is to remove enough excess water so that your curls aren't weighed down.  The second purpose is to keep your curls coiled while the moisture is being removed.  This helps curls keep from being stretched out in the drying process.  I'm confused about the 2nd plop.  I'm wondering if that's what is potentially flattening some of your curls.

I plop for 20-30 minutes after washing and styling my hair.  Then, I'll either diffuse to 10-20% dry or clip my roots and fully air dry.  Every once in a while, I will do an overnight plop if I shower just before bed and let it air dry in the morning.  If it's cold or I'm in a hurry, I diffuse to 10% dry.

A few weeks ago, another user suggested a new method for refreshing hair.  Basically, you plop dry hair in a very damp t-shirt instead of trying to refresh with a spray bottle which doesn't work well for some people.  When I wake up to a decent curl day and don't need much of a refresh, I use the wet t-shirt method to add moisture to my hair and scalp.  Otherwise, I only plop dripping wet hair. 

Having said all of that, I think your hair looks really good.  I think the biggest thing is to have patience.  Your hair already looks healthier and nicely defined.  I would definitely be happy with those results.  Keep in mind that most of the time, the shorter curly hair is, the curlier it gets.  I'm sure those shorter hairs will always be a bit curlier.",3a,tell take time natural curl pattern starting cgm best way encourage natural pattern head dive method stick started cgm august year abusing hair curl pattern wacky wave crown mix curl type nape neck cgm month curl improved little wacky hair wavy crown curly root ll cutting straighter end weekend high hope hair month pretty happy wacky hair starting improve wash thing encourage natural curl personal favorite styling denman brush ll pin curl stubborn section crown finger coiling doesn t seen people awesome result method s kind like training curl best looking s thing stand s good comb dry curly hair like follow method detangle shower wide tooth comb wet brush hair coated slippery conditioner m getting breakage way plopping affecting curl pattern main purpose plop remove excess water curl aren t weighed second purpose curl coiled moisture removed help curl stretched drying process m confused 2nd plop m wondering s potentially flattening curl plop 20 30 minute washing styling hair ll diffuse 10 20 dry clip root fully air dry overnight plop shower bed let air dry morning s cold m hurry diffuse 10 dry week ago user suggested new method refreshing hair basically plop dry hair damp t shirt instead trying refresh spray bottle doesn t people wake decent curl day t refresh use wet t shirt method add moisture hair scalp plop dripping wet hair having said hair look good biggest thing patience hair look healthier nicely defined definitely happy result mind time shorter curly hair curlier get m shorter hair bit curlier,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Morning/Nighttime Routines,Drying Methods,Detangling

I‚Äôve been doing a modified cgm for about 7 weeks now and I think I have type 2a-2b waves for the most part, but I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out a good way to style when wet. If I comb it in the shower with a wide tooth comb, set my part, lean over so my hair hangs down both sides of my face, and scrunch in product I get beautiful fat curl clumps. The problem is, they go around my head in one layer. It‚Äôs like putting a lampshade over my head. I have pretty long hair (past mid back) so long hair gets mixed with the shorter hair and pull those waves out. I also get zero volume doing this because of that.

33179,/r/curlyhair/comments/abunei/just_realized_that_no_one_in_my_life_knows_that_i/,"Just realized that no one in my life knows that I actually have naturally curly hair. Even my mum.I'm 25 years old and started embracing my natural 2c/3a about 6 months ago. I also live in a different country away from friends and family so no one has seen the transition in my hair to it's natural state.

When I was a kid, my hair WAS curly. Very. It was also always in a braid so no one really saw the full curliness. From around the 5th grade, my mum always straightened it out either chemically or with straighteners because she genuinely thought she was helping me out by making my hair more ""cool"" and also felt like she was a cool mum for doing that. I didn't know better obviously and it DID make my hair more manageable so this.... Went on for years. I don't blame my mum at all because, everyone at school had straight hair and also my mum let me color my hair and all that did make me feel cooler than I was XD 

But all this chemical damage took it's toll on my hair and it has thinned out quite a bit. Also throw PCOS into the mix and my hair sucks now. And my relatives would comment on how dead my hair looked. 

Then I found this subreddit and started the CGM around 6 months ago and this was the best decision I ever made. My hair seems Fuller, livelier and when I posted my first selfie with a head full of curls, I immediately received SO MANY messages from everyone I know.
Half of them raved about how cute my hair is and half of them asked if I had it done permanently. That's when I realized no one knew I was a curly head. Everyone always saw me with straight hair. I had to explain to those who asked, that I was letting my natural hair take control after so many years. 
Final verdict: EVERYONE loved it and said it suited me way more.

Also my mum loved it and poor thing felt sorry for straightening my hair but I just chalked it up to an experience in itself. She didn't know but now she does :)

Thank you r/curlyhair!!

I like to shampoo twice and then condition my hair and finger comb it to get all the knots out and then tie it up and let it sit whilst I do everything else in the shower. 

After I rinse my conditioner, I use a microfibre towel as this is much more gentle for the hair and reduces frizz. I then apply shea moisture styling milk and then shea moisture smoothie. I then let my hair air dry which can take foreverrr, but so worth it, then once my hair is completely dry, I fluff my hair out from the roots in all directions and then add some hair oil, one a pea size amount and fluff my hair out some more so my hair can have a nice shine and a little more moisture. 

Sometimes I will diffuse my hair after my weekly hair wash and if that‚Äôs the case I will use low heat and diffuse my hair until completely dry and then fluff it out with some hair oil. 

Also, a hair masque is nice to do twice a month. You can apply it the night before your wash day and rinse it out the next day.

* We have to wash more frequently than type 3+ curly girls. I can get away with 2-3 days max before my waves are limp, I feel like I have too much product in my hair, and my roots are starting to get greasy.

* It's ok to finger comb your hair while conditioning in the shower (I get bad knots if I don't)

* Try shampooing/conditioning with your hair flipped forward/upside down. It takes some practice but it makes a huge difference in volume for me. Rinse with cool water.

* Gel is the best to hold the waves, but it can build up after a couple days.

* Plopping doesn't really do *that* much to enhance my waves. I find just scrunching with a cotton shirt is more effective. I scrunch some water out, apply my gel/leave in conditioner, then scrunch some  more with the shirt. If you do plop, only do it for about 10 minutes.

The first week, I didn't have money to find silicone and sulfate free shampoo, so I used a normal Pantene one. My hair was shiny and detangled, but still was obviously dry and frizzy. I braided it for 2 days to keep it safe, and went the rest of the week putting argan oil on it. 

After that week was over, I used a sulfate AND silicone free shampoo. The first day it looked fine. It was way curlier than usual, still dry and frizzy though, but I was happy with the results. The day after, oh god, it was the worse I've seen it. It was way drier than all the other days and it was together in chunks and there were barely any curls. It also felt thin and like it was going to break if I pulled it a bit.

 I put up with it for 2 days, until I decided to do an oil treatment (a mix of argan oil with olive oil). I washed it out well with my shampoo, but my hair was now extremely oily! 

I gave up and used a normal SYOSS shampoo in order to fix it. My hair turned shiny again and it felt thick and strong. Since then, my hair is barely curly but it feels strong. It got tangled after the first day, the curls have turned into 2a waves and it's so annoying.

I have 2a/2bish wavy curls with very low porosity.  My hair is very fine but I have a lot of it.  I've been using various curly methods for five years now so I'm no stranger to this sub.

I cut most of my hair off at the beginning of the year since it was damaged, and I'm trying to help my hair stay healthy as it grows out this time.  The problems I'm running into is everything seems to weigh my hair down right now.

My current routine is shampoo with live clean daily shampoo(candian brand, sulfate-free), rinse out like normal, dry with a cotton t-shirt, then apply a palm-sized amount of mousse(herbal essence totally twisted) via praying hands, then I take a small amount of whatever hard-hold gel I have on hand and scrunch it in.  Then I usually diffuse on the cool setting until 80% dry.  This produces some nice waves and curls, however they are still falling out by the end of the day.  I've also noticed the mousse is making me break out along my back and hairline.  

Does anyone have any product recs/routines for REALLY fine and REALLY low porosity hair?  We're talking I have to use something very alkaline mixed with prolonged high heat before and during dying my hair and doing deep conditioning or nothing gets inside my hair.  I've had issues with protein in the past but I'm starting to think it was because the protein couldn't get inside my hair strands.

I would really just love some insight at this point.",2a,porosity fine wave hello fellow curlies 2bish wavy curl porosity hair fine various curly method year m stranger sub hair beginning damaged m trying hair stay healthy grows time problem m running weigh hair right current shampoo live clean daily shampoo candian brand sulfate free rinse like normal dry cotton t shirt apply palm sized mousse herbal essence totally twisted praying hand small hard hold gel hand scrunch usually diffuse cool setting 80 dry produce nice wave curl falling end day noticed mousse making break hairline doe product recs routine fine porosity hair talking use alkaline mixed prolonged high heat dying hair doing deep conditioning get inside hair issue protein past m starting protein couldn t inside hair strand insight point,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Heat Damage & Growing Advice,Drying Methods,Moisturizing and Deep Treatments

I've tried all 3 brushes all on wet hair (never ever ever ever dry!)

Tangle Teezer - ripped out my hair, but gave good definition. Gave the brush away.

Denman - the first styling brush I used. Similar definition to tangle teezer but takes forever to style because of the width of the pattel the smallest.

Behairful - newest brush! Still trying to figure out how to use it. 

What do you guys prefer???? :) :) :)

My waves are super dry it is also pool season and we visit the pool a lot due to my son doing swim there. We also finally got  a water softener two months ago and I love it. I am a 2B/2C normal to high porosity wavy that does dye their hair but haven't bleached it in over a year. I don't think I am super protein sensitive or anything I can't use DevaCurl I broke out all over my scalp with it. I am super worried about my hair drying out and getting fried like it did last year in the summer because we swim a lot in the pool like every other day. So I'm wondering if there are any tricks for care in the summer. I thought about maybe going to a not safe conditioner with cones in it for the summer to seal in moisture if that makes sense as I've never had a problem with them before.

&amp;#x200B;

My current routine:

Wash every 3-4 days- NYMN Sea Kale and Coconut Water, coconut oil makes me break out something fierce but I have had no reaction to this whatsoever. I also have been using the CurlMix Watermelon line for a good clarifying shampoo every two weeks.

Condition/Co-Wash (every 2nd day)- NYMN Sea Kale and Coconut Water or NYMN Honey Melon experimenting with this due to the dry weather here in UT it has a super strong smell I think it may be a no go. I sometimes use my CurlMix conditioner which is the bomb diggity but it is super pricey to use as a cowash/conditioner.

Deep condition in the shower once a week- NYMN Green Tea and Apple Blossom

Style- CurlMix sensitive line leave in while in the shower dripping wet. CurlMix sensitive flaxseed gel soaking wet in shower. My curls though were going super flat halfway through the day the last few weeks I think due to the weather and glycerin in them so I went ahead and got KCNT and KCCC and that has seemed to help a ton with my definition and I actually got it to last yesterday I do think I need more gel I only use like half a quarter so I need to increase that. Air dry in the summer cause I have no where to be as a teacher's aid during the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I am overthinking my hair at this point but it has been going super flat with the weather so far this early summer and the only think I can think of is glycerin/humectants pulling out the moisture.

I prewash with Redken pH bonder to strengthen my hair because of cleaning it. The bleaching is a non-negotiable which makes the pH bonder such.  

Wash/condition/leaving in conditioner with Shea moisture manuka honey &amp; yogurt hydrate + repair line products.  I sparingly use the leave in  after i squeeze the excess water out with a microfiber cloth and wide tooth comb it through while my head is upside down.  Then i flip my hair right side over and finger tease some body into it.  Then i let it mostly air dry and add a little more leave in conditioner to help define those curls.  After i sometime use a TINY bit ot hair spray to tame that frizz.  On no shampoo days i condition with sheamoisture coconut and cactus water head in the clouds conditioner.

I love that my face outlining curls are so eager to be beautiful again and hope that the body of my hair eventually smooths itself out and the curls re-establish themselves as nicely.  

I just started back with curly girl so i haven't found a holy Grail product.  Any recommendations to help with the frizz?  I only wash 1-2x a week and am REALLY low maintenance overall. I do not want to spend a bunch of time on my hair but have no issue working some product through it daily.

Final question, but probably the most important it's what do i do about that bottom layer of hair that is just so noticeablely uncurly?!  I know that it can curl because I've seen it!  But I've always had this issue with it!  Please help!

I have fine 2c hair and this Saturday I will be getting my first Devacut. I'm wanting to get a Devacut because prior to starting my curly girl journey, I got my hair chopped into a blunt lob so I have no layers. When straight, my hair is a little past my shoulders. When curly my hair rests on my shoulders. I have the shelf/triangle head going on because my hair is flat at my roots and gets voluminous on the bottom. The stylist told me to bring in pictures of what I was wanting. I'm struggling to find pictures of people with my similar hair type that have a length of cut that I want. I really don't want to lose any length, maybe just a little trim to clean up my ends and then adding in layers. However, I don't want crazy short layers because I put my hair up when I work out and sleep. I feel that whenever I get a haircut, I'm horrible at explaining what I want. I have a round face so I always tend to stay away from face-framing layers because they accentuate my round face. I'm nervous that my inability to explain what I want properly is going to ruin my Devacut. Anyone that can offer tips/advice for someone's first time Devacut is much appreciated!

Thanks if you actuslly read all this and help, haha.So I have very fine hair with like, 3 different curl patterns (2C, 3A, 3B). I've tried every way to do my hair, but for the last year my hair won't act like it had been for the past  10 before that.

Right now, I use innersense which I loved and started by recommendation by my awesome curly hair salon... I didn't know about that app that rates products thinkdirty, when I got them by the way; anyway I digressed... I use a chelating shampoo once a week, the ion from Sally's, and that's helped with fullness for sure. Also the Redken Cat protein is great too. As well as the Sally's generic brand of the matrix conditioning balm. Though, I only use the balm when I use the chelating shampoo otherwise I get moisture overload easily, so the Redken helps keep my strands in check. I also squish to condish! 

I've tried washing upside down, normal right side up. Adding products in upside down completely soaking, damp and between. Adding product right side up, soaking, damp and between. I've tried air drying, though using my diffuser seems to give me the best results still... I've tried a little and a lot of product and all amounts  between with again, either soaking, damp and in between wetness levels.

Raking seems to break up my curls and make them thin straw like. Scrunching, pulsing or glazing do not distribute the product at all either. The Denman and wet brush both do nothing to help either. 
I've tried many techniques using these brushes and nothing special other than distribution of product.

Right now, what seems to work the least bad, haha, is washing like normal, using the ion, innersense or the conditioning balm... Then I get some water out but still leave some in, enough that there's a lot but it's not dripping. I add a tiny tiny amount of the Blueberry Bliss leave in, which seems to be a great one, it's light enough but conditions well too, unless my hair is too moisturized, I'll skip that step that (and I'll conditioner if it's like crazy moisturized on accident, but that's rare). I'll add the Biosolk Hard Gellee which is a great hold, but I have to add a little bit, a penny amount. Then I plop gently while I do my skincare, then I diffuse upside down. I've tried the hover method, but shockingly doing the old school pile the curls into the diffuser and keeping still leaves my curls looking better, or not as bad, ha.

Note that I‚Äôm still looking for my holy grail low poo, but for now, my best hair days are days that start with a non approved clarifying shampoo. Low poo every day really weighs my hair down (but does make it glossy and frizz free!).

Products:
Shampoo, either just Carol‚Äôs Daughter black vanilla shampoo, or (non CG) suave clarifying shampoo. Or a mix!
Condition, my best luck has been with the tresemme coconut conditioner. Other stuff, again, weighs my hair down.
Still playing around with leave in. If I opt to use it, I either use a tiiiny bit of Shea moisture curl and style milk on soaking wet hair. I‚Äôve also been trying a little devacurl wavemaker. I always do leave in/non gel stylers in the shower on dripping hair, so my hair still clumps.
I use a wet brush in the shower to combat any tangles and also to distribute product. If things get stringy, I wet again.

Stopped using the products for obvious reasons and cut about 5 inches of hair off. The cut helped a little, but not a ton (I can attach a pic of my first wash post cut/stopping DevaCurl below).

Photo on the right is from today (washed this afternoon). I‚Äôm still playing around with products and application techniques, but here‚Äôs what I did today!

Routine:

1. Wash with Prose custom shampoo and massage my scalp. Rinse it out.
2. Squeeze most of the water out and apply Prose custom conditioner primarily to the bottom half of my hair (avoiding the roots) but lightly applying leftover/watery conditioner to the top/front pieces.
3. Comb the conditioner through my hair with my fingers as thoroughly as possible. Scrunch my hair a little so the curls/waves start to form. Probably left it on for about 7-10 minutes.
4. Rinse my hair out with my head flipped upside down, kinda do a S2C type of thing where I scrunch my hair (still flipped upside down) after I turn off the water.
5. Plop my hair in a microfiber towel for about a minute before applying Prose custom curl cream (with praying hands and scrunching it in) and then plopping it again for about 30 minutes. I think I used about 2-3 pumps worth for my whole head.
6. Take my hair out of the towel and apply the Aveda flax seed aloe strong hold sculpturing gel via the praying hands method and scrunching it in. Not sure how much I used exactly, maybe about 4-5 half dollar sized amounts?
7. Air dry my hair but I gently flip the part drastically from one side to the other every few minutes so that my hair doesn‚Äôt get flat at the roots.
8. Scrunch out the crunch a few hours later! The end.

A few things: I‚Äôm not sure exactly what my hair type or porosity is but I estimate I‚Äôm somewhere around a 2B (2C at parts) and high porosity because I lighten my hair every 3+ months via balayage. My hair tends to get really weighed down so I‚Äôve found that applying products while my hair is soaking wet = absolutely no volume (and looking like a sewer rat).

But I will be honest, I am a researcher and this is a tough one, so I really could use some recommendations on where to go. 

My hair

* long, down to mid back
* bleached balayage style (from warm brown to a golden blonde)
* thick 
* fairly dense
* super frizzy
* high porosity
* typically a 2c curl, but can range from 2b to 3a

My Routine

* Cowash with Suave conditioner or wash with a shea moisture curl shampoo
* detangle with a tresemme conditioner 
* squish to condish and set the start of curls with head upside down with the Shea Moisture curl conditioner 
* Scrunch out the excess water still upside down wtih a microfiber towel 
* add AsIAm leave in conditioner with praying hands
* scrunch in Shea Moisture high porosity gel and put a little Cantu wavy mousse on top
* Plop for up to 20 minutes 
* leaving head upside down, remove from tshirt and diffuse until I hope it is mostly dry

I am having trouble getting the crunch to scrunch out as well...any tips would be helpful.

-Not Your Mother‚Äôs Tahitian Gardenia Flower &amp; Mango Butter
-Shea Moisture Curl &amp;Shine Conditioner (S2C)
-Shea Moisture Extra Moisture detangler as my leave in
-also purchased Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Mousse

Problems/Questions -
1. After realizing I have low porosity, I think the Shea Moisture might be too heavy on my hair?
2. I plopped my hair after using the detangler, and after like 30 minutes it looked good, but was stringy and the shape fell (except for the underneath 2b I mentioned)
3. I am used to washing my hair like once a week, but I find that my hair loses all shape after day 1. Should I be rinsing it with water (or conditioning) daily and using the other products?
4. I usually wash at night and sleep on it, could I use the mousse at night and sleep on it to better hold my shape?

\-Apply loads of DevaCurl Decadence conditioner

\-Detangle with fingers and wide tooth comb

\-Squish to condish and leave a little as a leave-in

\-Apply JessiCurl Rockin Ringlets styling potion and DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel to wet hair

\-Squish out left over water and product

I'm going to the salon soon and am hoping to get professional advice as well. But in the meantime I wanted to see if anyone here had similar stories and could offer some help!

I've been doing CG for a few years with great results using DevaCurl! I would use No-Poo, One Condition, and SuperCream. But for a while I had a job outdoors and would tie my hair up all the time and only No-Poo and condition every few days. I started shedding a lot more around this time, so I got back onto my routine but I would shed just as much or even more! Once in the shower a whole glob of hair fell out. Then I found out about the ongoing DevaCurl lawsuit and ditched the products almost a month ago now.

I noticed a lot less breakage and shedding almost IMMEDIATELY with my newer products. As of right now I'm using Cantu shampoo and conditioner, Taliah Waajid curl cream, and KCCC. It's okay so far but my hair is much thinner than it used to be even less than six months ago and I just want my curls to be healthy and defined again. I've also been doing deep conditions with SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil Leave-In to try and restore my hair and that's been doing okay also. But none of it is really bringing me back to how it used to be quite yet.

tl;dr: I'm having to go on a new product and routine search since ditching DevaCurl after losing some hair, even though my DC routine was great for me at one point in time. But my main priority right now is to restore my 2c/3a hair back to how healthy it was.

The story of this post is that today was a particularly good hair day for me, which I was surprised about because it's been around 95 degrees out all day with pretty high humidity, and I went out with wet hair this morning while running errands, etc. I've always been a little afraid to actually post anything but I was really feeling it today so I went for it.  It's taken me about 2 years to figure out what actually works for my hair and I think I finally have my routine almost perfect. I only shampoo about once a week or (right now) whenever I feel I really need to as I have a outdoor, labor-intensive job and get pretty sweaty daily at work. I stick to mainly CG-friendly products and normally use either Shea Moisture black castor oil shampoo or sometimes a goat milk, sulfate-free solid shampoo bar my sister gifted me from a local crafter. I get my hair wet and only shampoo at the roots without running my fingers through the length of my hair at all (I actually never run my fingers or a brush through it, wet or dry, ever). I then use the squish to condish method for conditioner with my head upside down in the shower using Suave Naturals coconut conditioner, and I sometimes use up to two heaping handfuls based on how my hair feels that day. After, I make my shower water cool and rinse the conditioner out with my head upside down and squeeze out extra water, then use another small dollop of suave conditioner as a leave in. After getting out of the shower with still dripping-wet hair, with my head upside down again, I squish in a little palm-full of OGX renewing argan oil of Morocco penetrating oil, followed by a big glob of LA looks sport gel mixed with a little bit of Miss Jessie pillow soft curls. Plopping is definitely a key to my routine and I will leave my hair plopped as long as I can before going anywhere, sometimes up to an hour if possible. After taking my t-shirt off my head I shake my hair out (and have to comb my bangs) and then scrunch in more LA looks gel (my hair can handle a ton so I use a lot, which I think really holds in humidity). Then, I let my hair dry as much as possible and don't touch it at all until it's mostly just damp. I then scrunch/shake out any stiffness from the gel and it's done! I am looking for any suggestions for an oil-type product similar to the OGX one as I think that sometimes if I use even a small bit more than normal, it leaves parts of my hair feeling weighed down and less bouncy. Any oil suggestions are welcome! I hope this helps anyone with hair like mine :)

I also generally try to avoid aloe as an ingredient as it can act similarly to protein. I don't entirely avoid it, but it's so hit or miss for my hair that I try to. My curls can get weighed down pretty easily, so I currently only use mousse as my styler (Herbal Essences Totally Twisted).

I'm currently in a bind regarding leave-in. I know it's something I can skip, but there's often times where I can tell I need it. I currently use the Kinky-Curly Knot Today leave-in. Whenever I use it though, even when I can tell my hair needs moisture, my hair takes at LEAST 3x longer to dry, and dries super weighed down, even when clipped up to expedite the drying process and attempt to retain volume. Using mousse is practically pointless when doing this.

Does anyone have any recommendations for protein-free leave-ins that are fairly lightweight? Finding protein-free (and preferably aloe-free) products is already such a pain, that searching with any more parameters is frustrating and feels fruitless. I tried google and the one list I came across for lightweight leave-ins won't load so I can't even check if any of the suggestions are protein-free.

The best method I've found for alleviate shrinkage is the banding method. Naptural85 has a video on this. Essentially, you use hair bands or silk ties to band the hair lengthwise to retain length. Pineappling or mini pineapples also gets a lot of root stretch to increase length.

2. In terms of your hair goals, I think her curls have a wider diameter than yours. She looks closer to a 3C/4A or a pencil sized curls and penspring sized curls. That's not really changeable, but you can achieve more consistent and clumpy curls by keeping your hair moisturized, using a good gel and using good techniques. The shingling method is the best method for ultra definition, but it also takes the longest time. Tons of YouTube videos on it, but it entails smoothing and defining every single curl or curl group. The LOC/LCO method is the best for maintaining moisture. It's a 3 step process of using a water based leave-in conditioner, an oil, and an oil or butter based creamy leave-in.

But now since chopping and bleaching, I'm not sure how to approach the CGM. My hair is like 2a/2b, with low porosity. I've switched to the NYM Naturals Tahitian Gardenia Flower &amp; Mango Butter shampoo and conditioner since my hair is much dryer in texture. I have also begun deep conditioning with the same Shea Moisture mask once a week. To keep the brassiness out of my blonde, I am shampooing with a Purple Shampoo once a week (and then the NYM Naturals Tahitian Gardenia Flower &amp; Mango Butter the other time that week). 

I have always struggled getting curl near my roots even pre-chop/dye, and now I'm lost as to what products to use when I get out of the shower. Using the gel too close to my roots will just make them greasy (and I don't have much left length wise to put gel not close to the roots!). What mousse should I try now that my hair is dryer and shorter? Any suggestions on blonde hair care with CGM in general?

I will try to make this light and not too angry, because I am..pretty peeved. I apologize for any formatting errors, I am using an iPad.

Have any of you used the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt conditioner? I used the protein treatment and it works wonders on my thirsty hair. Recently, I got the conditioner in the pump bottle. Before that I used the regular squeeze tube. The squeeze tube worked fine for my 2b-2c hair, especially with combing and detangling in the shower. Then I got the pump, and everything is just AWFUL.

It was cheaper yet larger, for some reason. And I think I know why. My hair HATES this! I cannot even get my comb through my hair, nor my fingers, without ripping my hair right out. It does NOT condition and leaves my hair just as dry as it normally is. I noticed one of the ingredients form my squeeze tube that used to be one of the last ones, is now by the top, as in they are using more of it. However, I cannot confirm since I cannot see a difference in ingredients on Target, and my squeeze tube is long in the garbage. 

Am I delirious? Could there actually be a difference in the product so drastic that I cannot even use it anymore? Perhaps my hair has changed, or the product is a defective one. 

Have any of you had luck with it? Also, what conditioners would you recommend? Currently I use the Garner Papaya 1 minute mask and it works great as a regular conditioner.

3341,/r/curlyhair/comments/8uj87v/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_jun_28_2018/e1h1oxk/,"Hi, I'm trying to go into CG method after years of putting it off. I recently bought the Briogeo cowash and am planning on using that from now on. I don't think I'll need to strip my hair of anything since as of yesterday I recently had my hair washed and colored in a professional salon (so it feels pretty light atm). Let me know if I am wrong!

What's putting me at a loss is that I intend to continue getting my hair colored until blonde, and maybe even going to a platinum blonde a few months from now. I'm not sure how to balance CG hair health properly with this idea--I understand that on some level there will always be damage, but I'd like to mitigate it!

So far, I have been using Olaplex 2-3x a week as a leave-in that I just wash out the next day or even dampen my hair again with a spray bottle and add a dime-sized amount of Olaplex to let it treat my hair longer for another day.

For deep conditioners, I've picked up the Christophe Robin Blond Pur mask to use every other week, and the Briogeo Don't Despair, Repair! Deep conditioner to use alternatively.

Okay after all that, here is my question--

My stylist says I should use a keratin masque as a follow-up to using the Matrix Brass Off blue shampoo since I have more orange undertones to remove, but I know that shampoo isn't CG friendly and while I've done the keratin treatment when I was younger and have used keratin in the past, I wasn't really paying attention to how my hair reacted to it. I don't want to throw in too many variables but I don't want to skip out on further protection and repair to my hair if I need it! **Can you recommend some ""safe"" keratin deep treatments to use? Is it okay to use Matrix Brass Off or are there better more low-poo/curly hair safe blue shampoos out there? Can I just add blue food coloring to my briogeo cowash every once in a while?**

Reference:  Hair is wavy 2B.  The [reference picture here](https://imgur.com/J27ejwV) is after leaving the salon--they just blowdried my hair straight. ~~I dunno why~~  ^(jk I remember now it's because so I could see the color.)

I'm going back to where I attend school (visiting home for the summer so I can't go back to this stylist for a while) and have located a Devacut stylist who also specializes in balayage and blonding (luckily for me!) and uses Olaplex.

I skimmed through the CG guide and products list and they're a bit overwhelming but I think I got the gist of it. I'm looking for some products to help condition my ends while stopping the oily/buildup on my scalp and overall define my curls. I definitely need to get it trimmed again, but even when I do it still ends up with the outermost layer of curls being frizzy, poorly defined, and sad. In the middle layer, they're cute and defined and then underneath is nearly straight. Because the curls aren't uniform, I usually end up pulling the frizzy weird top layer into a half-up half-down style to show the nicer middle, but I hate doing that every day.

I've tried enough build-up busters (from DevaCurl and a few random home remedies) that effectively remove the grease, but it always ends up coming back and I was looking for some longer-term product that can help keep the buildup under control.

My wash routine:

I've been using the No-Poo DevaCurl cleanser every 2-3 days/whenever it needs to be washed and I condition with the original line of curly DevaCurl Conditioner nearly every day. Out of the shower, I'll squeeze out most of the water and use a little bit of the Not Your Mother's Curl Talk or Kinky moves or sometimes both depending on the day. I'm definitely guilty of not knowing a lot about how to take care of my hair &amp; I plan on using some free time to scroll further into this subreddit. Overall, I like the smell of the No-Poo but it's definitely the wrong formula for my hair. I tried DevaCurl's low-poo cleanser and it still wasn't doing what I was hoping for.

26331,/r/curlyhair/comments/f3dzvp/how_do_i_know_if_ive_achieved_a_balanced_porosity/,"How do I know if I've achieved a balanced porosity or swung too far the other way?Trying to nail down what my dissatisfaction with my CG routine. 

When I look at pictures from a few years ago BEFORE I started CG, I like and miss the volume I had then (my curl pattern ranges from 2a-2c right now, but looked more solidly 2b-2c then, better clumps). 

The thing is, I know my hair is healthier now. At the time I'm referencing, I had a lot of highlighting and damage from that. It was dry and brittle and you can see that from looking at it in these pictures...but the volume! And it held curl better. My cut is very similar to then, maybe a couple inches shorter, but still long. My hair is dense, and I think the strands vary in texture with my curl pattern - 2c areas seem more coarse, 2a areas might even be fine. 

I don't want the damaged look back, of course, but isn't there a happy medium where I can make it look more...fluffy? I feel like it looks limp now. 

I'm trying to work through whether this was maybe a porosity issue that I've over-corrected? Could it be that it was high porosity then, but my babying it the last few years (much more careful with coloring and using repairing and protective products, CG products, almost no heat styling at all, etc.) has repaired that to the point of medium or low porosity? 

When I run my fingers up a single strand, it squeaks. It does take hours and hours to air dry (easily 4+, but it's also dense). I feel like maybe it does take a while to get it wet in the shower. I don't necessarily have the impression that product sits on top (no flakes), but it does seem like all product is too heavy, too much. 

My gut feels like my hair never feels as clean as I want it to. And like any product I use (gel, mousse, leave-in, together or separate) just weighs it down. If I follow the beginners guide strictly, I get stringy, wet- and greasy-looking ""curls."" My hair just looks dirty with the LA gel. 

I've only been washing every 5-7 days and maybe not clarifying as often as I should. Maybe I need to trial every 3-4 days and make sure I'm clarifying once per month at least. Does that sound like the right track? 

Or am I chasing something that my hair just can't do when it's healthy? Maybe I just don't have a hair type that can be both healthy and have the volume I'm looking for at the same time? I have almost no breakage at all anymore, even on my curliest sections that used to be the most prone to breakage.",2a,achieved balanced porosity swung far way trying nail dissatisfaction look picture year ago started like miss volume curl pattern range right looked solidly better clump thing hair healthier time m referencing highlighting damage dry brittle looking picture volume held curl better similar couple inch shorter long hair dense strand vary texture curl pattern area coarse area fine t want damaged look course isn t happy medium look fluffy feel like look limp m trying porosity issue corrected high porosity babying year careful coloring repairing protective product product heat styling repaired point medium porosity run finger single strand squeak doe hour hour air dry easily 4 s dense feel like doe wet shower t necessarily impression product sits flake doe like product heavy gut feel like hair feel clean want like product use gel mousse leave separate weighs follow beginner guide strictly stringy wet greasy looking curl hair look dirty la gel washing 5 7 day clarifying trial 3 4 day m clarifying month doe sound like right track chasing hair t s healthy t hair healthy volume m looking time breakage anymore curliest section prone breakage,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Morning/Nighttime Routines,Heat Damage & Growing Advice,Curlygirl Method

I have been really struggling finding curlygirl friendly products with no coconut derived ingredients. Please help!Hi, I would really appreciate some advice and recommendations. It was suggested I cross post here from r/haircarescience, thank you!


As said in the title, I'm really allergic to coconut and anything coconut derived. This includes the ever present coco-betaine, as well as coconut diethanolamide, cocamide sulfate, cocamide DEA, CDEA, and basically anything else with ""coco"" somewhere in the name. In addition, I'm very sensitive to SLS (sodium laureth sulfate).


I didn't have this problem nearly as much years ago as there were a lot of products that relied on palm oils or hemp oils and such, but it seems that coco-betaine has really taken the haircare world by storm and I am really struggling now to find any haircare products that don't contain either coconut derived ingredients or that don't contain SLS and similar acne/itching inducing sulfates. All products I used to use from child to adulthood that my hair loved have now reformulated to use coconut based cleaners. Don't get me wrong- ethically and environmentally I support the move away from palm oil etc, but it puts me in a serious bind!


The extra injury to insult is that I was hit by a semi truck two years ago that left me with a traumatic brain injury and I'm still struggling to recover. One of the things I still really have trouble with is reading, and searching through long complicated ingredient lists for any and all of the many forms of coconut is a task that seems precisely calculated to be what I'm worst at. This means that I keep making mistakes and buying products that I think are safe, or, I've checked ingredients online and they check out but then I start having a reaction and realize that what I bought at the store has the same name but a different ingredient list than what I read about! My fiance has been an absolute saint helping me with so many daily tasks and with the medical and insurance paperwork that I've been overwhelmed with in addition to supporting us both since the accident that I feel terrible asking him to devote even more time to meticulously reading conditioner bottles when he has so much on his plate.


So, I'm hoping that the reddit hair community might be willing to help me find a product that I can use and rely on! I really really appreciate your kindness in advance, I know it is an annoying task but I could really use your help.


***


**Hair type:** Thick, wavy probably 2A, but maybe 2c? 


**Current Routine:** Trying to do co-wash only because a) my hair seemed to like it and b) I can't find a shampoo I can use anyway. Wash with conditioner every 3-4 days, squish to condish, rinse thoroughly (I still seem to break out on my back if I do any leave in). Plop then air dry. I have done a beginner routine reset shampoo recently.


**Current product:** Shea Moisture raw Shea butter restorative conditioner


**Current problems:** Although this conditioner miraculously doesn't contain anything I'm allergic to, I find that my scalp is really itchy and my hair is very dry and prone to tangling and breaking. It weirdly feels like I'm almost not even using conditioner it seems so rough and tangled even just after washing. I've also been having increasingly annoying dandruff and I don't know what I should do about it as I haven't had that problem before I had to switch from my last product when it started containing coco-betaine. I've also in the past used Garnier Whole Blends repairing conditioner ""honey treasures"" which is also ok allergy wise (at least, last I checked) but I found it left my hair fairly heavy and itchy too without using shampoo, and when I put it into the curly girl ingredient checker it says it's not CG friendly.

Routine:

* Clairfy w/ Bumble&amp;Bumble Sunday Shampoo every other Sunday followed by the Hask Argan Oil Reparing Deep Conditioner --&gt; Squish to condish out, followed by DevaCurl One Condition Delight, S&amp;C and rinse by S&amp;C'ing under running water
   * Otherwise, I wash every other day w/ DevaCurl Low-Poo Delight and condition with the DevaCurl One Condition Delight... same steps as above just nix the deep conditioner
* Squish out as much water as I can with my hands, use a cotton t-shirt to get out water so I'm not dripping everywhere and apply about a dime-sized amount of Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Milk
* Apply a quarter-sized amount of Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Scrunching Gel --&gt; scrunch scrunch scrunch! 
* Plop for about 30 minutes
* Allow the rest to air dry! Flip head upside down to scrunch out the crunch

\*\*Sometimes I'll use DevaClips to create a little more volume.... I do everything with my hair parted in the middle and then usually flip to the left like shown in the picture. I haven't quite mastered sleeping and maintaining my curls (I've been pineappling my top layers and using a buff) but I'm getting DAMN good at refreshing in the mornings.

&amp;#x200B;

Refresh routine:

* Spray with a spray bottle till hair is dripping a bit. For the most part this reactivates the product already in my hair
* Scrunch with a small amount of my hair gel, really focusing on the parts that I need (usually the front)
* Spritz BOLDIFY Hair Thickening Spray
* DevaClip if needed
* Air dry and scrunch out the crunch!

Unfortunately my attempt to boost my pre-CG curls, have led to me taking 2 steps back. [Check out my before and after pics](https://imgur.com/a/MbHz6aY)
Not the best reference images, but you can see that I have a nice curl pattern at the best of times, and I‚Äôm a really minimal wavy at the worst of times. My attempt to jump into CG has only brought me disappointment and frustration (with the expense of product hopping, and the anger of a longer styling with poor results). Any suggestions?

I seem to be around a 2b on my good days (but I think my hair has potential for 2c), low-porosity (via float test), and medium density. 

Current CG Method
Shower, with lightly warm water. Shampoo and clean scalp with Not Your Mother‚Äôs Naturals shampoo. Rinse out. Figure out my part and wide tooth comb it into place (minimally). Prayer hands/scrunch in Garnier Whole Blends repairing conditioner. Scrunch scrunch hanging head to side (sometimes flip hair and scrunch. Rinse out, sometimes while scrunching. 
Turn off water and scrunch hair so its not dripping. Generously scrunch in Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Boosting Mousse.  Scrunch in minimal amount of LA Looks. Plop for awhile, and then air dry/ diffuse until dry.

DevaCurl made me a TOTAL GREASE BALL. 
Co-washing didn‚Äôt make me feel clean.
Coconut curls shampoo &amp; conditioner didn‚Äôt seem to help much. Felt like the shampoo didn‚Äôt disperse in my hair well.
Shea Moisture was a similar experience to coconut curls.

7053,/r/curlyhair/comments/eis5ms/itchy_ms_and_other_concerns_routine_and_questions/fct5ptr/,"Hi everyone and a happy new year! I have wavy hair (thick strands with average volume, somewhere between 2a and 2b) and I started the CGM a week and a half ago. 

Routine:

Used Suave Clarifying Shampoo the first day and conditioned my hair with Suave Essentials conditioner (the coconut one). I wash my hair on alternate days with Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and condition it with the Suave Essentials conditioner and then STC and wash it out mostly. On the rest of the days, I cowash with the Suave Essentials conditioner, STC and wash it out. Out of the shower, I soak up the excess water using an old t-shirt, apply LA Looks Gel using the praying hand method, plop my hair for half an hour and then let it air dry (I am going to get a diffuser eventually), and when my hair is completely dry, I SOTC.

My problem is that the CGM makes my scalp itchy and leaves little build-ups(?)/scabs on my scalp. I googled the reasons and turns out that it was PROBABLY because of the itchy Ms which the Suave Conditioner and LA Looks Hair Gel both have. I was convinced that the hair gel and/or the conditioner were making my scalp itchy but I found out that the shampoo (Aussie Miracle Curls) I regularly used before I started CGM had the Itchy Ms too and I never had a similar reaction to it so I am guessing it wasn't the Itchy Ms? I am so confused! 

Additionally, I have had mixed experiences with the LA Looks Gel; it gives my waves a nice cast (I think, please see the pictures in the post, has there been any drastic improvement since I started using the CGM?) and helps a lot with the frizz which I like, but it's flaky sometimes and leaves my hair dry and rough even after I scrunch out the crunch. Ever since I started using the gel, I don't get the same clean feeling I used to get when I would just shampoo and condition my hair and let it air dry naturally.

I am a freshly graduated student who's currently looking for a job, so I would prefer not to spend a lot of money on buying new expensive hair products when I already have new products I just bought. Are there any gels that are in a similar price range as LA Looks that give a nice cast but don't have the same issues? What about Eco Styler Olive Oil Styling Gel? I have heard good things about it but I am hesitant about buying it. Thanks for taking out the time to read through my post, I really appreciate your help.

25835,/r/curlyhair/comments/bxw8ix/fine_wavy_2aish_that_has_been_really_struggling/,"Fine wavy (2A-ish) that has been really struggling with achieving waves through traditional CGM. Can anyone help with products/methods?I've already posted to r/wavyhair but I figured I'd try this sub as well since it's more popular.

I have fine, medium density hair. I have no idea what the porosity is, I thought it was low porosity because of the water test but it is likely inaccurate for me after doing more research. I know that my hair is at least 2A, but I struggled to get my waves to appear and I got so frustrated that after maybe 3 months of the CG method I gave up and stopped doing it all together.

My former routine:
- Wash 1x week with TJ Tea Tree Shampoo
- Cowash 3x week with TJ Tea Tree Conditioner
- Condition 3-4x week with Garnier Whole Blends Legendary Olive Conditioner
- S2C, Shea Moisture Curl-Defining Cream, Eco Professional Gel, plopping, break the cast (this or any combination of these methods/products)
- Clarify my hair every 4-6 weeks

I have since learned, with help from lovely people at r/wavyhair, that products with olive oil and coconut tend to be too heavy for fine hair, as well as Shea Moisture products, that cowashing isn't great for wavies, and that wavies need to clarify more (more like every 3 weeks). Fixing the cowashing and clarifying issue is easy enough, but I have no idea what products to use in my hair. I'm not sure how well Eco Professional Gel (the Argan Oil kind) works for me either - regardless of if I scrunch in a lot or a little of the gel in, or if my hair is soaking wet or on the drier side, it's very hard for my waves to form and hold which leads me to think the gel is too heavy for my hair. I've also tried protein treatments (I have literally no idea if it did anything, I didn't notice much of a difference) and deep conditioning with Shea Moisture (the coconut one) which of course is probably too heavy.

I'm considering switching to a mousse (the Herbal Essences one seems popular among fine wavies from what I can tell) or a leave in conditioner, but I don't want to run out and buy new products quite yet.

So, fellow fine wavies: What products do you use for your hair, and what methods work best for you?

When you say you‚Äôve tried Sulfate free shampoo before, did you also cut out silicones? Because if you cut out Sulfates without also cutting out silicones, there‚Äôs nothing to wash out the silicones and it‚Äôll lead to your hair not absorbing moisture, and also getting greasy. So if you cut out silicones as well you might notice a big difference! Plus, CG also entails cutting out drying alcohols. 

If shampoo in general is still too drying for you, then the ultimate CG thing to do is of course just cowash! However I would say your hair looks very similar to mine in terms of thickness/density, and cowashing doesn‚Äôt really work for me, and definitely not at the start! You might be different though! I currently use a specific cowash product (lighter and slightly more cleansing than a regular conditioner), and a CG shampoo at least once a week. 

So I would say you should try the beginner routine, with the caveat that you might want to add a CG shampoo since cowashing mighttt weigh your hair down. (This would of course be in addition to the clarifying shampoo you‚Äôll need for your first wash either way) 

CG is at least 50% method rather than just product, so do make sure to implement some of the techniques listed in the wiki! (Eg lots of scrunching, rinsing upside down, drying with a t shirt or microfibre towel etc)

2C/with some 3A curls. Others mixed in too. Normal scalp.

The hair in the back/crown of my head is much coarser texture than the rest of my hair. It always feels dry and frizzy, even when I do a deep condition with heat cap and apply products with denman brush. I usually have to re-wet and apply more leave in conditioner and cream/gel to that area and still sometimes that doesn't tame it.

[day 2 curls were not great either, but this patch on the back of my head is OUT. OF. CONTROL. ](https://preview.redd.it/ogkf41d3h0s41.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b7ceef2c3bd8b58d7ab3a40dbdc74b81502212c)

I am pretty sure my hair hates protein. I did a protein mask once and my hair felt TERRIBLE after, but also sometimes it is frizzy when it's wet. 

I also think I have a low aloe threshold. The other day the Bounce gel made my hair feel terrible because I think I used too much. 

Here are the products I've tried, in various combinations (today's combo outlined below)   
Shampoos/Conditioners  
\- bounce moisture / cream conditioner / clarifying shampoo (+)  
\- Giovanni 50/50 (good for a reset)  
\- jessiCurl gentle lather shampoo (no)  
\- as I am coconut cowash (cowashing leaves too much buildup)  
\- LUS shampoo/conditioner (meh)

Deep conditioners/treatments   
\- Rawkyn Red (good)  
\- Mielle protein free (I also tried their protein treatment) (nothing special)  
\- Oyin deep treatment mask (too heavy)  
\- Hask coconut oil deep treatment   
\- Raw Sugar masque (nothing special)

Leave in conditioners   
\- KC knot today (ok)  
\- bounce leave in (usually pretty good)  
\- Camille Rose moisture milk (too heavy)

Products  
\- Aussie instant freeze (pretty good)  
\- Kinky Curly Coiling Custard (flash dry?)  
\- Curls Blueberry Bliss Gel (didn't do much)  
\- bounce clumping cream (fine line between not enough and too much)  
\- bounce light cream gel (love it, but does t quite do the trick)  
\- herbal Essenses mousse (nah)  
\-LUS wavy (builds up fast)  
\- AG reCoil (really like this but doesn't quite do the trick)  


Methods: 

I've tried wet plopping, dry plopping, diffusing and air drying. I think a short dry plop and air dry works best. I always expect better results from diffusing, but am usually disappointed with the results (hover method). My hair takes hours to air dry. 

Today, I was having a really good hair day...until I wasn't. Everything was great and then the patch on the back of my head got really fluffy, frizzy and rough. it's so frustrating! it's a party in the front, a nightmare in the back.

My routine today was:   
\- Bounce moisturizing shampoo, cream conditioner  
\- small amount of bounce leave in, followed by some AG recoil.   
\- tiny amount of bounce light cream gel, and some.aussie instant freeze on top.   
\- Plopped for 10, then air dry, scrunched out with argan oil.   
(Dew point less than 55)

Is this hygral fatigue? bad p-m balance? does this part of my hair need something completely different than the rest of my head? how do you do that? 

  
Other notes:   
\- silk pillowcase, buff (not every night),   
\- occasionally pre-poo with jojoba oil  
\- I've been full steam CG for about 3 months now. No damage from hot tools or dye. I was using Lus religiously for about a year (with moderate success--/lots of buildup) before i decided to dig in to Cg for real.

does anyone else skip the cast? do you have a better softer feeling with mouse? are those living proof products curly girl approved?

I think i have medium posterity or whatever it is and i think my hair is like a 2a maybbbe a 2b wave, any advice?

also can anyone explain cowashing better?

The longest parts of my hair were really struggling to hold their curl and most days I ended up with s-waves that just looked like unbrushed straight hair. Then u/sar_brown64 recommended trying a gelatin mask. I had a quiet evening last night with nothing to lose if my hair ended up hating it so I went to Walmart and got me some jello. 

I washed my hair with the NYM Tahitian gardenia mango butter shampoo (or whatever it‚Äôs called lmao). Then I put in the gel mask which was just 1 pack of flavorless gelatin mixed into 1 cup of hot water (id let it cool by now). A lot of recipes add ACV but I really didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with the smell. I left the mix on until it dried, which was about 25 minutes? I did help it out with a hairdryer tho. 

Then I rinsed my hair. First without touching it until it was soft again, then went in with my fingers to get all the product out. S2C with Suave Essentials conditioner which I only left on for maybe 2-5 minutes. 

Out of the shower I squeezed as much water out of my hair as possible with just my hands, then brought in a cotton t-shirt to squeeze a little more (all of this was done upside down). Let it air dry like that for about 15 minutes while I did my skincare, then added the herbal essences tousle me softly mousse upside down. 

I don‚Äôt have a diffuser yet and my hair is too short to plop without flattening it, so what I do instead is scrunch up the longest parts with my hand and then use a jaw clip to hold it. I don‚Äôt twist it into the jaw clip or anything like that. I just scrunch my hair with my fingers and place the jaw clip exactly where my fingers were to basically have it act as my scrunching hand. I leave that on for about an hour then take the jaw clip out and go to bed. I don‚Äôt have a satin or silk pillowcase, but I do have a silk scarf I put over my pillow lmao! 

Last night I could already tell my hair was much, much wavier and when I woke up and SOTC and saw these waves I almost cried! I texted like 5 people.

5980,/r/curlyhair/comments/chw1dd/protein_products_frizz/euygnzp/,"Hi! I‚Äôve been following the CGM for about 3 weeks now and I am absolutely loving the improvements in my hair so far! I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to tame the frizz in my low porosity 2B/2C hair and was looking into the protein/moisture balance since noticing that the presence of glycerin in my products doesn‚Äôt effect my hair to the degree I originally believed (I live in a hot and humid area). 

My hair often feels a little too soft and I‚Äôve noticed my waves falling out by the end of the day and my hair becoming flat and limp despite using gels. I know hair doesnt stay perfect all day, but I included some photos taken 7ish hours apart. I did the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Yogurt Hydrate and Repair Protein Power Treatment two days ago, which smells amazing but leaves my hair reaaaallly moisturized and doesn‚Äôt seem to do much protein wise. I also have a ton of wet frizz. I tried the rice water rinse by boiling the rice around a week ago and didnt notice much of a difference, however, it did dry out small sections of my hair- maybe I didn‚Äôt prep the rice water correctly? I was looking into the ApHogee 2 minute treatment and even looking into Olaplex no 3 to see if maybe I dont need protein, but a bond repair. I‚Äôm still trying to understand the current state of my hair and I don‚Äôt want to push it into protein overload. 

I use the Not Your Mothers Curl Talk styling cream (which has protein) and the DevaCurl Ulta Defining Gel (also has protein). I recently (two days ago) switched over to using the NYM CT Mousse to see if maybe the cream was too heavy for my hair along with the Jessicurl Spiralicious Gel to see if removing Glycerin would help combat my frizz issue (which it does for a while, then it frizzes up as time progresses).  I know that sounds like a lot of styling products- but I only use 2 at a time to prevent my hair from being weighed down and have played with the amount of each product with no success.

That gives my very big and loose curls a bit of bounce and volume back. Then I spray (quite a bit) of water and use the praying hand technique to get all the water and then the products in my hair. The combing gives my curls and waves a bit of  bounce and volume back so they don't turn out stringy (which they don't if I don't comb them), the water and the products give back a bit of definition! :)

This takes me about 10 minutes, whereas completely washing my hair takes up to 1 hour.

11008,/r/curlyhair/comments/bt2xwz/denman_brush_got_me_the_results_finally_worth/eotewgp/,"I can't believe the day has come! Just like many here, my hair has been a HUGE battle my whole life and I always thought I just had frizzy, poofy, unmanageable hair. Until I found CG method my hair was my #1 biggest self confidence issue. I have extremely thick, coarse, dense, 2C hair. As a kid it was so hard to manage and my mom found the japanese thermal reconditiong/permanent straightening. I did this from the age of 12-23. I also used to use all sorts of crazy products and blow dry/straighten my hair to oblivion. In 2018 at the age of 27 I was diagnosed with a rare and malignant type of cancer on my head and had to get a large portion of my scalp scalp removed (hence the bald spot). After that I was determined to stop using all these caustic chemicals on my head, and subsequently found NoPoo and then CG. This whole process has been life changing for me and I can't believe I finally am comfortable with the hair on my head. Also as a side note I actually about a year ago I also got a very large undercut (I would say about 70-80% of my hair is actually shaved off on the underside). I had WAY too much hair to manage and am very happy with the amount I have now as it still looks thick and full. Anyways, thank you so much to this community. It has helped me in so many ways! I change my routine and producs all the time as I am still experimenting, but will post what I did today for this.

Routine:

1. Shampoo with Cantu cleansing creme shampoo
2. Condition with VO5 blackberry and sage tea conditioner
3. Brush with Denman brush while sopping wet with conditioner still in hair
4. Squish conditioner in with ""squish to condish"" method to form curls and clumps
5. Rinse most of conditioner out
6. Turn off shower and immediately apply a large amount of Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie
7. Distribute product through hair with Denman brush with hair still soaking wet and then ""squish to condish"" that in
8. Apply a large amount (lemon size glob) of gel with praying hands. I was running out of gel and actually had a mix of Eco Styler with castor oil and Aussie instant freeze together in a tub to use up the last bits of both. I have been planning to go back to L.A. Looks after these were gone because I like the more watery texture of L.A. looks. The other two are more sticky/tacky and I find it harder to squish my waves into place with those.
9. Very gently and carefully squish/micro plop with my hands and then a t-shirt to encourage the waves/curls and keep the large clumps in tact
10. Plopped with long sleeve t-shirt just while I got dressed
11. Let air dry for hours and hours until fully dry
12. In this picture I actually had not SOTC yet, but when I do I always use a good amount of oil (right now I use Mane Choice hair growth oil) to smooth out the frizz and give an even more well hydrated look.

Whew that was a lot! Thanks for taking the time to read :) My routine so far is an accumulation of all the tips I've tried here so far over the months and what has been working for me.

23240,/r/curlyhair/comments/cff1hx/good_gels_for_fine_curls/euar5lz/,"Most gels have crunch. You just scrunch the cast (crunch) and it leaves you with soft, defined hair. 

There are different techniques you can use to lessen the crunch. Some people get less crunch applying gel to soaking wet hair, or using a lot of leave-in conditioner underneath the gel. Diffusing your hair helps to break up some of the cast. Personally, I diffuse my hair, sleep with it crunchy in a pineapple bun and when I wake up, the crunch is almost always gone. There are soft hold gels that don't form as strong of a cast. Using less gel help.

My hair is fine, but pretty thick. It gets weighed down easily being 2c-3c with mostly 3a and b. I generally prefer a softer hold gel. The LA Looks Nutra Curl has a very soft cast, no protein or glycerin. It is a thicker gel, so I emulsify it with warm water in my hands and then apply it to my hair in sections using small amounts of gel at a time. Suave Max Hold is thick, too, but it makes my curls springy. It has no glycerin and a tiny amount of protein. Eco gel has a medium hold, but scrunches out pretty easily, is also a thicker gel, has some glycerin and protein. The As I Am Curling Jelly and the Cantu Define and Shine Custard are lighter hold. They both have glycerin. They both have a thin, runny texture. You only need smalls amounts on very wet hair. The Cantu custard is the only ones I've had issues with flaking, and that's only when you use too much.

If you aren't using one already, a stronger sulfate-free shampoo should help with any buildup. Using lighter products with no or almost no oils and butters will help prevent your hair from being weighed down. I like big, defined hair. When I switched up to lighter products and started using a more cleansing shampoo, it helped a lot.",3c,gel crunch scrunch cast crunch leaf soft defined hair different technique use lessen crunch people crunch applying gel soaking wet hair leave conditioner underneath gel diffusing hair help break cast personally diffuse hair sleep crunchy pineapple bun wake crunch gone soft hold gel t form strong cast gel hair fine pretty get weighed easily b generally prefer softer hold gel la look nutra curl soft cast protein glycerin thicker gel emulsify warm water hand apply hair section small amount gel time suave max hold make curl springy glycerin tiny protein eco gel medium hold scrunch pretty easily thicker gel glycerin protein curling jelly cantu define shine custard lighter hold glycerin runny texture small amount wet hair cantu custard one issue flaking s use aren t stronger sulfate free shampoo buildup lighter product oil butter prevent hair weighed like big defined hair switched lighter product started cleansing shampoo helped,Wavy or Frizzy Hair,Drying Methods,Moisturizing and Deep Treatments,Morning/Nighttime Routines

* Wash every other day with Redken Color Extend Shampoo
* Deep Condition with DevaCurl One Condition Conditioner
* Lightly rinse and wrap in microfiber towel
* When damp, halfway dry, I smooth in a couple drops of DevaCurl One Condition
* Then, using DevaCurl Defining Gel, I stand with my head upside-down and scrunch my curls. 
* When my head is right-side up, I twist the curls with my fingers for more definition. 
* Then I wait for it to air-dry and I scrunch the crunch out.

Just need to know how to get that volume since I didn't think to write down the product name!

My hair is 2a (possibly 2b in a few places out back), low porosity (i.e. my hair didn't sink at all during the float test), I think it needs more protein (i.e. wet strand stretches more than it should).  My hair is not super fine but probably on the side of normal to thin and gets greasy easily.  

I used Suave clarifying shampoo once and then started with the DevaCurl wavy kit (Delight shampoo &amp; conditioner, mousse + gel) but my hair felt really dry &amp; my scalp itchy.

For the picture above, I tried NYM Blue Sea Kale &amp; Coconut shampoo &amp; conditioner, did a modified S2C in the shower (not all the way upside down) and then applied the NYM blue sea kale mousse while it was still wet, hanging head upside down and squishing.  Then I let it air dry and scrunched out the crunch.

My hair just looks dry, tangled &amp; frizzy... I'd appreciate any help or suggestions!!!",2a,wavy hair new cgnew trying t making progress advice hair possibly place porosity e hair didn t sink float test need protein e wet strand stretch hair super fine probably normal get greasy easily suave clarifying shampoo started devacurl wavy kit delight shampoo conditioner mousse gel hair felt dry scalp itchy picture tried nym blue sea kale coconut shampoo conditioner did modified s2c shower way upside applied nym blue sea kale mousse wet hanging head upside squishing let air dry scrunched crunch hair look dry tangled frizzy d appreciate suggestion,Drying Methods,Moisturizing and Deep Treatments,Morning/Nighttime Routines,Devacurl
1049,/r/curlyhair/comments/ac5kdf/the_weekly_no_question_is_dumb_thread_jan_03_2019/edla5tw/,"Maybe I'm dumb but I tried the porosity water test (place three hairs in a bowl and wait 4 mins) the results said I have lp (they didn't sink), however when I took the online test it said I had high porosity? I have 2A curls, I believe.

Also, my hair is curly when wet, but when it starts to dry it unravels looking non curly but wavy. Will I always have to gel and diffuse? I tried the diffuse and gel today, and my curls looks great. I'm seeing how long it lasts. I plopped until mostly dry, added the gel, then diffused until ~90% dry.

Gel I used was Gariner Fructis Style Pure Clean.

My routine (1 week long)

1) with luke warm/cold-ish water: wash hair upside down with sheamoisture: raw shea butter. Rinse

2) squish in suave coconut conditioner: comb while I wait. starting from the end of hair. Rinse

3) ring out extra water and using pea size amount of sheamoisture gel souffle finger comb it through my hair.

4) plop hair and leave until mostly dry. (I do not plop all night)

I don't use a gel regularly yet as I'm kinda iffy on how to use it correctly. I was plopping with the gel in but it made my hair sticky and stringy. Even after crunching the sticky cast (it never hardened, but stayed sticky)

Thank you for any tips and for taking your time to read this :)
